3</span>WOMAN&rsquo;S WORK IN A COUNTRY PARISH. <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been asked to speak a few
words to you on a lady&rsquo;s work in a country parish.&nbsp; I
shall confine myself rather to principles than to details; and
the first principle which I would impress on you is, that we must
all be just before we are generous.&nbsp; I must, indeed, speak
plainly on this point.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s first duties are to
her own family, her own servants.&nbsp; Be not deceived: if
anyone cannot rule her own household, she cannot rule the Church
of God.&nbsp; If anyone cannot sympathise with the servants with
whom she is in contact all day long, she will not really
sympathise with the poor whom she sees once a week.&nbsp; I know
the temptation not to believe this is very great.&nbsp; It seems
so much easier to women to do something for the poor, than for
their own ladies&rsquo; maids, and house-maids, and cooks.&nbsp;
And why?&nbsp; Because they can treat the poor as <i>things</i>:
but they <i>must</i> treat their servants as persons.&nbsp; A
lady can go into a poor cottage, lay down the law to the
inhabitants, reprove them for sins to which she has never been
tempted; tell them how to set things right, which, if she had the
doing of them, I fear she would do even more confusedly and
slovenly than they.&nbsp; She can give them a tract, as she might
a pill; and then a shilling, as something sweet after the
medicine; and she can go out again and see no more of them till
her benevolent mood recurs: but with the servants it is not
so.&nbsp; She knows their characters; and, what is more, they
know hers; they know her private history, her little
weaknesses.&nbsp; Perhaps she is a little in their power, and she
is shy with them.&nbsp; She is afraid of beginning a good work
with them, because, if she does, she will be forced to carry it
out; and it cannot be cold, dry, perfunctory, official: it must
be hearty, living, loving, personal.&nbsp; She must make them her
friends; and perhaps she is afraid of doing that, for fear they
should take liberties, as it is called&mdash;which they very
probably will do, unless she keeps up a very high standard of
self-restraint and earnestness in her own life&mdash;and that
involves a great deal of trouble, and so she is tempted, when she
wishes to do good, to fall back on the poor people in the
cottages outside, who, as she fancies, know nothing about her,
and will never find out whether or not she acts up to the rules
which she lays down for them.&nbsp; Be not deceived, I say, in
this case also.&nbsp; Fancy not that they know nothing about
you.&nbsp; There is nothing secret which shall not be made
manifest; and what you do in the closet is surely proclaimed (and
often with exaggeration enough and to spare) on the
house-top.&nbsp; These poor folks at your gate know well enough,
through servants and tradesmen, what you are, how you treat your
servants, how you pay your bills, what sort of temper you have;
and they form a shrewd, hard estimate of your character, in the
light of which they view all that you do and say to them; and
believe me, that if you wish to do any real good to them, you
must begin by doing good to those who lie still nearer to you
than them.&nbsp; And believe me, too, that if you shrink from a
hearty patriarchal sympathy with your own servants, because it
would require too much personal human intercourse with them, you
are like a man who, finding that he had not powder enough to fire
off a pocket-pistol, should try to better matters by using the
same quantity of ammunition in an eighty-four pound gun.&nbsp;
For it is this human friendship, trust, affection, which is the
very thing you have to employ towards the poor, and to call up in
them.&nbsp; Clubs, societies, alms, lending libraries are but
dead machinery, needful, perhaps, but, like the iron tube without
the powder, unable to send the bullet forth one single inch; dead
and useless lumber, without humanity; without the smile of the
lip, the light of the eye, the tenderness of the voice, which
makes the poor woman feel that a soul is speaking to her soul, a
heart yearning after her heart; that she is not merely a
<i>thing</i> to be improved, but a sister to be made conscious of
the divine bond of her sisterhood, and taught what she means when
she repeats in her Creed, &ldquo;I believe in the communion of
saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is my text, and my
key-note&mdash;whatever else I may say to-day is but a carrying
out into details of the one question, How may you go to these
poor creatures as woman to woman?</p>
<p>Your next duties are to your husband&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s
servants and workmen.&nbsp; It is said that a clergyman&rsquo;s
wife ought to consider the parish as <i>her</i> flock as well as
her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It may be so: I believe the dogma to
be much overstated just now.&nbsp; But of a landlord&rsquo;s, or
employer&rsquo;s wife (I am inclined to say, too, of an
officer&rsquo;s wife), such a doctrine is absolutely true, and
cannot be overstated.&nbsp; A large proportion, therefore, of
your parish work will be to influence the men of your family to
do their duty by their dependants.&nbsp; You wish to cure the
evils under which they labour.&nbsp; The greater proportion of
these are in the hands of your men relatives.&nbsp; It is a
mockery, for instance, in you to visit the fever-stricken
cottage, while your husband leaves it in a state which breeds
that fever.&nbsp; Your business is to go to him and say,
&ldquo;<i>Here is a wrong</i>; <i>right it</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This, as many a beautiful Middle Age legend tells us, has been
woman&rsquo;s function in all uncivilised times; not merely to
melt man&rsquo;s heart to pity, but to awaken it to duty.&nbsp;
But the man must see that the woman is in earnest: that if he
will not repair the wrong by justice, she will, if possible (as
in those old legends), by self-sacrifice.&nbsp; Be sure this
method will conquer.&nbsp; Do but say: &ldquo;If you will not
new-roof that cottage, if you will not make that drain, I
will.&nbsp; I will not buy a new dress till it is done; I will
sell the horse you gave me, pawn the bracelet you gave me, but
the thing shall be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let him see, I say, that
you are in earnest, and he will feel that your message is a
divine one, which he must obey for very shame and weariness, if
for nothing else.&nbsp; This is in my eyes the second part of a
woman&rsquo;s parish work.&nbsp; I entreat you to bear it in mind
when you hear, as I trust you will, lectures in this place upon
that <i>Sanitary Reform</i>, without which all efforts for the
bettering of the masses are in my eyes not only useless, but
hypocritical.</p>
<p>I will suppose, then, that you are fulfilling home duties in
self-restraint, and love, and in the fear of God.&nbsp; I will
suppose that you are using all your woman&rsquo;s influence on
the mind of your family, in behalf of tenants and workmen; and I
tell you frankly, that unless this be first done, you are paying
a tithe of mint and anise, and neglecting common righteousness
and mercy.&nbsp; But you wish to do more: you wish for personal
contact with the poor round you, for the pure enjoyment of doing
good to them with your own hands.&nbsp; How are you to set about
it?&nbsp; First, there are clubs&mdash;clothing-clubs,
shoe-clubs, maternal-clubs; all very good in their way.&nbsp; But
do not fancy that they are the greater part of your parish
work.&nbsp; Rather watch and fear lest they become substitutes
for your real parish work; lest the bustle and amusement of
playing at shopkeeper, or penny-collector, once a week, should
blind you to your real power&mdash;your real treasure, by
spending which you become all the richer.&nbsp; What you have to
do is to ennoble and purify the <i>womanhood</i> of these poor
women; to make them better daughters, sisters, wives, mothers:
and all the clubs in the world will not do that; they are but
palliatives of a great evil, which they do not touch; cloaks for
almsgiving, clumsy means of eking out insufficient wages; at
best, kindly contrivances for tricking into temporary thriftiness
a degraded and reckless peasantry.&nbsp; Miserable, miserable
state of things! out of which the longer I live I see less hope
of escape, saving by an emigration, which shall drain us of all
the healthy, strong, and brave among the lower classes, and leave
us, as a just punishment for our sins, only the cripple, the
drunkard, and the beggar.</p>
<p>Yet these clubs <i>must</i> be carried on.&nbsp; They make
life a little more possible; they lighten hearts, if but for a
moment; they inculcate habits of order and self-restraint, which
may be useful when the poor man finds himself in Canada or
Australia.&nbsp; And it is a cruel utilitarianism to refuse to
palliate the symptoms because you cannot cure the disease
itself.&nbsp; You will give opiates to the suffering, who must
die nevertheless.&nbsp; Let him slip into his grave at least as
painlessly as you can.&nbsp; And so you must use these charitable
societies, remembering all along what a fearful and humbling sign
the necessity for them is of the diseased state of this England,
as the sportula and universal almsgiving was of the decadence of
Rome.</p>
<p>However, the work has to be done; and such as it is, it is
especially fitted for young unmarried ladies.&nbsp; It requires
no deep knowledge of human nature.&nbsp; It makes them aware of
the amount of suffering and struggling which lies around them,
without bringing them in that most undesirable contact with the
coarser forms of evil which house-visitation must do; and the
mere business habits of accuracy and patience to which it compels
them, are a valuable practical schooling for them themselves in
after-life.&nbsp; It is tiresome and unsentimental drudgery, no
doubt; but perhaps all the better training on that account.&nbsp;
And, after all, the magic of sweetness, grace, and courtesy may
shed a hallowing and humanising light over the meanest work, and
the smile of God may spread from lip to lip, and the light of God
from eye to eye, even between the giver and receiver of a penny,
till the poor woman goes home, saying in her heart, &ldquo;I have
not only found the life of my hand&mdash;I have found a sister
for time and for eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is another field of parish usefulness which I cannot
recommend too earnestly, and that is, the school.&nbsp; There you
may work as hard as you will, and how you will&mdash;provided you
do it in a loving, hearty, cheerful, <i>human</i> way, playful
and yet earnest; two qualities which, when they exist in their
highest power, are sure to go together.&nbsp; I say, how you
will.&nbsp; I am no pedant about schools; I care less what is
taught than how it is taught.&nbsp; The merest rudiments of
Christianity, the merest rudiments of popular instruction, are
enough, provided they be given by lips which speak as if they
believed what they said, and with a look which shows real love
for the pupil.&nbsp; Manner is everything&mdash;matter a
secondary consideration; for in matter, brain only speaks to
brain; in manner, soul speaks to soul.&nbsp; If you want
Christ&rsquo;s lost-lambs really to believe that He died for
them, you will do it better by one little act of interest and
affection, than by making them learn by heart whole
commentaries&mdash;even as Miss Nightingale has preached Christ
crucified to those poor soldiers by acts of plain outward
drudgery, more livingly, and really, and convincingly than she
could have done by ten thousand sermons, and made many a noble
lad, I doubt not, say in his heart, for the first time in his
wild life, &ldquo;I can believe now that Christ died for me, for
here is one whom He has taught to die for me in like
wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this blessed effect of school-work,
remember, is not confined to the children.&nbsp; It goes home
with them to the parents.&nbsp; The child becomes an object of
interest and respect in their eyes, when they see it an object of
interest and respect in yours.&nbsp; If they see that you look on
it as an awful and glorious being, the child of God, the co-heir
of Christ, they learn gradually to look on it in the same
light.&nbsp; They become afraid and ashamed (and it is a noble
fear and shame) to do and say before it what they used to do and
say; afraid to ill-use it.&nbsp; It becomes to them a mysterious
visitor (sad that it should be so, but true as sad) from a higher
and purer sphere, who must be treated with something of courtesy
and respect, who must even be asked to teach them something of
its new knowledge; and the school, and the ladies&rsquo; interest
in the school, become to the degraded parents a living sign that
those children&rsquo;s angels do indeed behold the face of their
Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p>Now, there is one thing in school-work which I wish to press
on you; and that is, that you should not confine your work to the
girls; but bestow it as freely on those who need it more, and who
(paradoxical as it may seem) will respond to it more deeply and
freely&mdash;<i>the boys</i>.&nbsp; I am not going to enter into
the reasons <i>why</i>.&nbsp; I only entreat you to believe me,
that by helping to educate the boys, or even (when old enough),
by taking a class (as I have seen done with admirable effect) of
grown-up lads, you may influence for ever not only the happiness
of your pupils, but of the girls whom they will hereafter
marry.&nbsp; It will be a boon to your own sex as well as to ours
to teach them courtesy, self-restraint, reverence for physical
weakness, admiration of tenderness and gentleness; and it is one
which only a lady can bestow.&nbsp; Only by being accustomed in
youth to converse with ladies, will the boy learn to treat
hereafter his sweetheart or his wife like a gentleman.&nbsp;
There is a latent chivalry, doubt it not, in the heart of every
untutored clod; if it dies out in him (as it too often does), it
were better for him, I often think, if he had never been born:
but the only talisman which will keep it alive, much more develop
it into its fulness, is friendly and revering intercourse with
women of higher rank than himself, between whom and him there is
a great and yet a blessed gulf fixed.</p>
<p>I have left to the last the most important subject of all; and
that is, what is called &ldquo;visiting the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is an endless subject; if you go into details, you might write
volumes on it.&nbsp; All I can do this afternoon is to keep to my
own key-note, and say, Visit whom, when, and where you will; but
let your visits be those of woman to woman.&nbsp; Consider to
whom you go&mdash;to poor souls whose life, compared with yours,
is one long malaise of body, and soul, and spirit&mdash;and do as
you would be done by; instead of reproving and fault-finding,
encourage.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s name, encourage.&nbsp; They
scramble through life&rsquo;s rocks, bogs, and thornbrakes,
clumsily enough, and have many a fall, poor things!&nbsp; But
why, in the name of a God of love and justice, is the lady,
rolling along the smooth turnpike-road in her comfortable
carriage, to be calling out all day long to the poor soul who
drags on beside her over hedge and ditch, moss and moor,
bare-footed and weary-hearted, with half-a-dozen children at her
back: &ldquo;You ought not to have fallen here; and it was very
cowardly to lie down there; and it was your duty, as a mother, to
have helped that child through the puddle; while, as for sleeping
under that bush, it is most imprudent and
inadmissible?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why not encourage her, praise her,
cheer her on her weary way by loving words, and keep your
reproofs for yourself&mdash;even your advice; for <i>she</i> does
get on her way, after all, where <i>you</i> could not travel a
step forward; and she knows what she is about perhaps better than
you do, and what she has to endure, and what God thinks of her
life-journey.&nbsp; The heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a
stranger intermeddleth not with its joy.&nbsp; But do not be a
stranger to her.&nbsp; Be a sister to her.&nbsp; I do not ask you
to take her up in your carriage.&nbsp; You cannot; perhaps it is
good for her that you cannot.&nbsp; It is good sometimes for
Lazarus that he is not fit to sit at Dives&rsquo;s
feast&mdash;good for him that he should receive his evil things
in this life, and be comforted in the life to come.&nbsp; All I
ask is, do to the poor soul as you would have her do to you in
her place.&nbsp; Do not interrupt and vex her (for she is busy
enough already) with remedies which she does not understand, for
troubles which you do not understand.&nbsp; But speak comfortably
to her, and say: &ldquo;I cannot feel <i>with</i> you, but I do
feel <i>for</i> you: I should enjoy helping you, but I do not
know how&mdash;tell me.&nbsp; Tell me where the yoke galls; tell
me why that forehead is grown old before its time: I may be able
to ease the burden, to put fresh light into the eyes; and if not,
still tell me, simply because I am a woman, and know the relief
of pouring out my own soul into loving ears, even though in the
depths of despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, paradoxical as it may seem,
I am convinced that the only way to help these poor women humanly
and really, is to begin by confessing to them that you do not
know how to help them; to humble yourself to them, and to ask
their counsel for the good of themselves and of their neighbours,
instead of coming proudly to them, with nostrums ready
compounded, as if a doctor should be so confident in his own
knowledge of books and medicine as to give physic before asking
the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.</p>
<p>Therefore, I entreat you to bear in mind (for without this all
visiting of the poor will be utterly void and useless), that you
must regulate your conduct to them, and in their houses, even to
the most minute particulars, by the very same rules which apply
to persons of your own class.&nbsp; Never let any woman say of
you (thought fatal to all confidence, all influence!):
&ldquo;Yes, it is all very kind: but she does not behave to me as
she would to one of her own quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Piety,
earnestness, affectionateness, eloquence&mdash;all may be
nullified and stultified by simply keeping a poor woman standing
in her own cottage while you sit, or entering her house, even at
her own request, while she is at meals.&nbsp; She may decline to
sit; she may beg you to come in, all the more reason for refusing
utterly to obey her, because it shows that that very inward gulf
between you and her still exists in her mind, which it is the
object of your visit to bridge over.&nbsp; If you know her to be
in trouble, touch on that trouble as you would with a lady.&nbsp;
Woman&rsquo;s heart is alike in all ranks, and the deepest sorrow
is the one of which she speaks the last and least.&nbsp; We
should not like anyone&mdash;no, not an angel from heaven, to
come into our houses without knocking at the door, and say:
&ldquo;I hear you are very ill off&mdash;I will lend you a
hundred pounds.&nbsp; I think you are very careless of money, I
will take your accounts into my own hands;&rdquo; and still less
again: &ldquo;Your son is a very bad, profligate, disgraceful
fellow, who is not fit to be mentioned; I intend to take him out
of your hands and reform him myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither do the
poor like such unceremonious mercy, such untender tenderness,
benevolence at horse-play, mistaking kicks for caresses.&nbsp;
They do not like it, they will not respond to it, save in
parishes which have been demoralised by officious and
indiscriminate benevolence, and where the last remaining virtues
of the poor, savage self-help and independence, have been
exchanged (as I have too often seen them exchanged) for organised
begging and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I would that you would all read, ladies, and consider well the
traits of an opposite character which have just come to light (to
me, I am ashamed to say, for the first time) in the Biography of
Sidney Smith.&nbsp; The love and admiration which that truly
brave and loving man won from everyone, rich or poor, with whom
he came in contact, seems to me to have arisen from the one fact,
that without perhaps having any such conscious intention, he
treated rich and poor, his own servants and the noblemen his
guests, alike, and <i>alike</i> courteously, considerately,
cheerfully, affectionately&mdash;so leaving a blessing and
reaping a blessing wheresoever he went.</p>
<p>Approach, then, these poor women as sisters, and you will be
able gradually to reverse the hard saying of which I made use
just now: &ldquo;Do not apply remedies which they do not
understand, to diseases which you do not understand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Learn lovingly and patiently (aye, and reverently, for there is
that in every human being which deserves reverence, and must be
reverenced if we wish to understand it)&mdash;learn, I say, to
understand their troubles, and by that time they will have learnt
to understand your remedies, and they will appreciate them.&nbsp;
For you <i>have</i> remedies.&nbsp; I do not undervalue your
position.&nbsp; No man on earth is less inclined to undervalue
the real power of wealth, rank, accomplishments,
manners&mdash;even physical beauty.&nbsp; All are talents from
God, and I give God thanks when I see them possessed by any human
being; for I know that they, too, can be used in His service, and
brought to bear on the true emancipation of woman&mdash;her
emancipation, not from man (as some foolish persons fancy), but
from the devil, &ldquo;the slanderer and divider&rdquo; who
divides her from man, and makes her live a life-long tragedy,
which goes on in more cottages than in palaces&mdash;a vie
&agrave; part, a vie incomprise&mdash;a life made up half of
ill-usage, half of unnecessary, self-willed, self-conceited
martyrdom, instead of being (as God intended) half of the human
universe, a helpmeet for man, and the one bright spot which makes
this world endurable.&nbsp; Towards making her that, and so
realising the primeval mission by every cottage hearth, each of
you can do something; for each of you have some talent, power,
knowledge, attraction between soul and soul, which the
cottager&rsquo;s wife has not, and by which you may draw her to
you with (as the prophet says) human bonds and the cords of love:
but she must be drawn by them alone, or your work is nothing, and
though you give the treasures of Ind, they are valueless equally
to her and to Christ; for they are not given in His name, which
is that boundless tenderness, consideration, patience,
self-sacrifice, by which even the cup of cold water is a precious
offering&mdash;as God grant your labour may be!</p>

SCIENCE OF HEALTH. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> the British race is
improving or degenerating?&nbsp; What, if it seem probably
degenerating, are the causes of so great an evil?&nbsp; How they
can be, if not destroyed, at least arrested?&nbsp; These are
questions worthy attention, not of statesmen only and medical
men, but of every father and mother in these isles.&nbsp; I shall
say somewhat about them in this Essay; and say it in a form which
ought to be intelligible to fathers and mothers of every class,
from the highest to the lowest, in hopes of convincing some of
them at least that the science of health, now so utterly
neglected in our curriculum of so-called education, ought to be
taught&mdash;the rudiments of it at least&mdash;in every school,
college, and university.</p>
<p>We talk of our hardy forefathers; and rightly.&nbsp; But they
were hardy, just as the savage is usually hardy, because none but
the hardy lived.&nbsp; They may have been able to say of
themselves&mdash;as they do in a State paper of 1515, now well
known through the pages of Mr. Froude: &ldquo;What comyn folk of
all the world may compare with the comyns of England, in riches,
freedom, liberty, welfare, and all prosperity?&nbsp; What comyn
folk is so mighty, and so strong in the felde, as the comyns of
England?&rdquo;&nbsp; They may have been fed on &ldquo;great
shins of beef,&rdquo; till they became, as Benvenuto Cellini
calls them, &ldquo;the English wild beasts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they
increased in numbers slowly, if at all, for centuries.&nbsp;
Those terrible laws of natural selection, which issue in
&ldquo;the survival of the fittest,&rdquo; cleared off the less
fit, in every generation, principally by infantile disease, often
by wholesale famine and pestilence; and left, on the whole, only
those of the strongest constitutions to perpetuate a hardy,
valiant, and enterprising race.</p>
<p>At last came a sudden and unprecedented change.&nbsp; In the
first years of this century, steam and commerce produced an
enormous increase in the population.&nbsp; Millions of fresh
human beings found employment, married, brought up children who
found employment in their turn, and learnt to live more or less
civilised lives.&nbsp; An event, doubtless, for which God is to
be thanked.&nbsp; A quite new phase of humanity, bringing with it
new vices and new dangers: but bringing, also, not merely new
comforts, but new noblenesses, new generosities, new conceptions
of duty, and of how that duty should be done.&nbsp; It is
childish to regret the old times, when our soot-grimed
manufacturing districts were green with lonely farms.&nbsp; To
murmur at the transformation would be, I believe, to murmur at
the will of Him without whom not a sparrow falls to the
ground.</p>
<blockquote><p>The old order changeth, yielding place to the
new,<br />
And God fulfils himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our duty is, instead of longing for the good old custom, to
take care of the good new custom, lest it should corrupt the
world in like wise.&nbsp; And it may do so thus:</p>
<p>The rapid increase of population during the first half of this
century began at a moment when the British stock was specially
exhausted; namely, about the end of the long French war.&nbsp;
There may have been periods of exhaustion, at least in England,
before that.&nbsp; There may have been one here, as there seems
to have been on the Continent, after the Crusades; and another
after the Wars of the Roses.&nbsp; There was certainly a period
of severe exhaustion at the end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, due
both to the long Spanish and Irish wars and to the terrible
endemics introduced from abroad; an exhaustion which may have
caused, in part, the national weakness which hung upon us during
the reign of the Stuarts.&nbsp; But after none of these did the
survival of the less fit suddenly become more easy; or the
discovery of steam power, and the acquisition of a colonial
empire, create at once a fresh demand for human beings and a
fresh supply of food for them.&nbsp; Britain, at the beginning of
the nineteenth century, was in an altogether new social
situation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the great French war; and, indeed, ever
since the beginning of the war with Spain in 1739&mdash;often
snubbed as the &ldquo;war about Jenkins&rsquo;s
ear&rdquo;&mdash;but which was, as I hold, one of the most just,
as it was one of the most popular, of all our wars; after, too,
the once famous &ldquo;forty fine harvests&rdquo; of the
eighteenth century, the British people, from the gentleman who
led to the soldier or sailor who followed, were one of the
mightiest and most capable races which the world has ever seen,
comparable best to the old Roman, at his mightiest and most
capable period.&nbsp; That, at least, their works testify.&nbsp;
They created&mdash;as far as man can be said to create
anything&mdash;the British Empire.&nbsp; They won for us our
colonies, our commerce, the mastery of the seas of all the
world.&nbsp; But at what a cost!</p>
<blockquote><p>Their bones are scattered far and wide,<br />
By mount, and stream, and sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Year after year, till the final triumph of Waterloo, not
battle only, but worse destroyers than shot and
shell&mdash;fatigue and disease&mdash;had been carrying off our
stoutest, ablest, healthiest young men, each of whom represented,
alas! a maiden left unmarried at home, or married, in default, to
a less able man.&nbsp; The strongest went to the war; each who
fell left a weaklier man to continue the race; while of those who
did not fall, too many returned with tainted and weakened
constitutions, to injure, it may be, generations yet
unborn.&nbsp; The middle classes, being mostly engaged in
peaceful pursuits, suffered less of this decimation of their
finest young men; and to that fact I attribute much of their
increasing preponderance, social, political, and intellectual, to
this very day.&nbsp; One cannot walk the streets of any of our
great commercial cities without seeing plenty of men, young and
middle-aged, whose whole bearing and stature shows that the manly
vigour of our middle class is anything but exhausted.&nbsp; In
Liverpool, especially, I have been much struck not only with the
vigorous countenance, but with the bodily size of the mercantile
men on &rsquo;Change.&nbsp; But it must be remembered always,
first, that these men are the very &eacute;lite of their class;
the cleverest men; the men capable of doing most work; and next,
that they are, almost all of them, from the great merchant who
has his villa out of town, and perhaps his moor in the Highlands,
down to the sturdy young volunteer who serves in the
haberdasher&rsquo;s shop, country-bred men; and that the question
is, not what they are like now, but what their children and
grandchildren, especially the fine young volunteer&rsquo;s, will
be like?&nbsp; A very serious question I hold that to be, and for
this reason.</p>
<p>War is, without doubt, the most hideous physical curse which
fallen man inflicts upon himself; and for this simple reason,
that it reverses the very laws of nature, and is more cruel even
than pestilence.&nbsp; For instead of issuing in the survival of
the fittest, it issues in the survival of the less fit: and
therefore, if protracted, must deteriorate generations yet
unborn.&nbsp; And yet a peace such as we now enjoy, prosperous,
civilised, humane, is fraught, though to a less degree, with the
very same ill effect.</p>
<p>In the first place, tens of thousands&mdash;who knows it
not?&mdash;lead sedentary and unwholesome lives, stooping,
asphyxiated, employing as small a fraction of their bodies as of
their minds.&nbsp; And all this in dwellings, workshops, what
not?&mdash;the influences, the very atmosphere of which tend not
to health, but to unhealth, and to drunkenness as a solace under
the feeling of unhealth and depression.&nbsp; And that such a
life must tell upon their offspring, and if their offspring grow
up under similar circumstances, upon their offspring&rsquo;s
offspring, till a whole population may become permanently
degraded, who does not know?&nbsp; For who that walks through the
by-streets of any great city does not see?&nbsp; Moreover, and
this is one of the most fearful problems with which modern
civilisation has to deal&mdash;we interfere with natural
selection by our conscientious care of life, as surely as does
war itself.&nbsp; If war kills the most fit to live, we save
alive those who&mdash;looking at them from a merely physical
point of view&mdash;are most fit to die.&nbsp; Everything which
makes it more easy to live; every sanitary reform, prevention of
pestilence, medical discovery, amelioration of climate, drainage
of soil, improvement in dwelling-houses, workhouses, gaols; every
reformatory school, every hospital, every cure of drunkenness,
every influence, in short, which has&mdash;so I am
told&mdash;increased the average length of life in these islands,
by nearly one-third, since the first establishment of life
insurances, one hundred and fifty years ago; every influence of
this kind, I say, saves persons alive who would otherwise have
died; and the great majority of these will be, even in surgical
and zymotic cases, those of least resisting power, who are thus
preserved to produce in time a still less powerful progeny.</p>
<p>Do I say that we ought not to save these people if we
can?&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; The weakly, the diseased whether
infant or adult, is here on earth; a British citizen; no more
responsible for his own weakness than for his own
existence.&nbsp; Society, that is, in plain English, we and our
ancestors, are responsible for both; and we must fulfil the duty,
and keep him in life; and, if we can, heal, strengthen, develop
him to the utmost; and make the best of that which &ldquo;fate
and our own deservings&rdquo; have given us to deal with.&nbsp; I
do not speak of higher motives still; motives which, to every
minister of religion, must be paramount and awful.&nbsp; I speak
merely of physical and social motives, such as appeal to the
conscience of every man&mdash;the instinct which bids every
human-hearted man or woman to save life, alleviate pain, like Him
who causes His sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and His
rain to fall on the just and on the unjust.</p>
<p>But it is palpable that in doing so we must, year by year,
preserve a large percentage of weakly persons who, marrying
freely in their own class, must produce weaklier children, and
they weaklier children still.&nbsp; Must, did I say?&nbsp; There
are those who are of opinion&mdash;and I, after watching and
comparing the histories of many families, indeed of every one
with whom I have come in contact for now five-and-thirty years,
in town and country, can only fear that their opinion is but too
well founded on fact&mdash;that in the great majority of cases,
in all classes whatsoever, the children are not equal to their
parents, nor they, again, to their grand-parents of the beginning
of the century; and that this degrading process goes on most
surely and most rapidly in our large towns, and in proportion to
the antiquity of those towns, and therefore in proportion to the
number of generations during which the degrading influences have
been at work.</p>
<p>This and cognate dangers have been felt more and more deeply,
as the years have rolled on, by students of human society.&nbsp;
To ward them off, theory after theory has been put on paper,
especially in France, which deserve high praise for their
ingenuity, less for their morality, and, I fear, still less for
their common sense.&nbsp; For the theorist in his closet is
certain to ignore, as inconvenient to the construction of his
Utopia, certain of those broad facts of human nature which every
active parish priest, medical man, or poor-law guardian has to
face every day of his life.</p>
<p>Society and British human nature are what they have become by
the indirect influences of long ages, and we can no more
reconstruct the one than we can change the other.&nbsp; We can no
more mend men by theories than we can by coercion&mdash;to which,
by-the-bye, almost all these theorists look longingly as their
final hope and mainstay.&nbsp; We must teach men to mend their
own matters, of their own reason, and their own free-will.&nbsp;
We must teach them that they are the arbiters of their own
destinies; and, to a fearfully large degree, of their
children&rsquo;s destinies after them.&nbsp; We must teach them
not merely that they ought to be free, but that they are free,
whether they know it or not, for good and for evil.&nbsp; And we
must do that in this case, by teaching them sound practical
science; the science of physiology as applied to health.&nbsp;
So, and so only, can we cheek&mdash;I do not say stop
entirely&mdash;though I believe even that to be ideally possible;
but at least cheek the process of degradation which I believe to
be surely going on, not merely in these islands, but in every
civilised country in the world, in proportion to its
civilisation.</p>
<p>It is still a question whether science has fully discovered
those laws of hereditary health, the disregard of which causes so
many marriages disastrous to generations yet unborn.&nbsp; But
much valuable light has been thrown on this most mysterious and
most important subject during the last few years.&nbsp; That
light&mdash;and I thank God for it&mdash;is widening and
deepening rapidly.&nbsp; And I doubt not that in a generation or
two more, enough will be known to be thrown into the shape of
practical and provable rules; and that, if not a public opinion,
yet at least, what is more useful far, a widespread private
opinion will grow up, especially among educated women, which will
prevent many a tragedy and save many a life.</p>
<p>But, as to the laws of personal health: enough, and more than
enough, is known already, to be applied safely and easily by any
adults, however unlearned, to the preservation not only of their
own health, but of that of their children.</p>
<p>The value of healthy habitations, of personal cleanliness, of
pure air and pure water, of various kinds of food, according as
each tends to make bone, fat, or muscle, provided
only&mdash;provided only&mdash;that the food be unadulterated;
the value of various kinds of clothing, and physical exercise, of
a free and equal development of the brain power, without undue
overstrain in any one direction; in one word, the method of
producing, as far as possible, the mentem sanam in corpore sano,
and the wonderful and blessed effects of such obedience to those
laws of nature, which are nothing but the good will of God
expressed in facts&mdash;their wonderful and blessed tendency, I
say, to eliminate the germs of hereditary disease, and to
actually regenerate the human system&mdash;all this is known;
known as fully and clearly as any human knowledge need be known;
it is written in dozens of popular books and pamphlets.&nbsp; And
why should this divine voice, which cries to man, tending to sink
into effeminate barbarism through his own hasty and partial
civilisation: &ldquo;It is not too late.&nbsp; For your bodies,
as for your spirits, there is an upward, as well as a downward
path.&nbsp; You, or if not you, at least the children whom you
have brought into the world, for whom you toil, for whom you
hoard, for whom you pray, for whom you would give your
lives,&mdash;they still may be healthy, strong, it may be
beautiful, and have all the intellectual and social, as well as
the physical advantages, which health, strength, and beauty
give.&rdquo;&mdash;Ah, why is this divine voice now, as of old,
Wisdom crying in the streets, and no man regarding her?&nbsp; I
appeal to women, who are initiated, as we men can never be, into
the stern mysteries of pain, and sorrow, and
self-sacrifice;&mdash;they who bring forth children, weep over
children, slave for children, and, if they have none of their
own, then slave, with the holy instinct of the sexless bee, for
the children of others&mdash;Let them say, shall this thing
be?</p>
<p>Let my readers pardon me if I seem to write too
earnestly.&nbsp; That I speak neither more nor less than the
truth, every medical man knows full well.&nbsp; Not only as a
very humble student of physiology, but as a parish priest of
thirty years&rsquo; standing, I have seen so much unnecessary
misery; and I have in other cases seen similar misery so simply
avoided; that the sense of the vastness of the evil is
intensified by my sense of the easiness of the cure.</p>
<p>Why, then&mdash;to come to practical suggestions&mdash;should
there not be opened in every great town in these realms a public
school of health?&nbsp; It might connect itself with&mdash;I hold
that it should form an integral part of&mdash;some existing
educational institute.&nbsp; But it should at least give
practical lectures, for fees small enough to put them within the
reach of any respectable man or woman, however poor, I cannot but
hope that such schools of health, if opened in the great
manufacturing towns of England and Scotland, and, indeed, in such
an Irish town as Belfast, would obtain pupils in plenty, and
pupils who would thoroughly profit by what they hear.&nbsp; The
people of these towns are, most of them, specially accustomed by
their own trades to the application of scientific laws.&nbsp; To
them, therefore, the application of any fresh physical laws to a
fresh set of facts, would have nothing strange in it.&nbsp; They
have already something of that inductive habit of mind which is
the groundwork of all rational understanding or action.&nbsp;
They would not turn the deaf and contemptuous ear with which the
savage and the superstitious receive the revelation of
nature&rsquo;s mysteries.&nbsp; Why should not, with so hopeful
an audience, the experiment be tried far and wide, of giving
lectures on health, as supplementary to those lectures on animal
physiology which are, I am happy to say, becoming more and more
common?&nbsp; Why should not people be taught&mdash;they are
already being taught at Birmingham&mdash;something about the
tissues of the body, their structure and uses, the circulation of
the blood, respiration, chemical changes in the air respired,
amount breathed, digestion, nature of food, absorption,
secretion, structure of the nervous system&mdash;in fact, be
taught something of how their own bodies are made and how they
work?&nbsp; Teaching of this kind ought to, and will, in some
more civilised age and country, be held a necessary element in
the school course of every child, just as necessary as reading,
writing, and arithmetic; for it is after all the most necessary
branch of that &ldquo;technical education&rdquo; of which we hear
so much just now, namely, the technic, or art, of keeping oneself
alive and well.</p>
<p>But we can hardly stop there.&nbsp; After we have taught the
condition of health, we must teach also the condition of disease;
of those diseases specially which tend to lessen wholesale the
health of townsfolk, exposed to an artificial mode of life.&nbsp;
Surely young men and women should be taught something of the
causes of zymotic disease, and of scrofula, consumption, rickets,
dipsomania, cerebral derangement, and such like.&nbsp; They
should be shown the practical value of pure air, pure water,
unadulterated food, sweet and dry dwellings.&nbsp; Is there one
of them, man or woman, who would not be the safer and happier,
and the more useful to his or her neighbours, if they had
acquired some sound notions about those questions of drainage on
which their own lives and the lives of their children may every
day depend?&nbsp; I say&mdash;women as well as men.&nbsp; I
should have said women rather than men.&nbsp; For it is the women
who have the ordering of the household, the bringing up of the
children; the women who bide at home, while the men are away, it
may be at the other end of the earth.</p>
<p>And if any say, as they have a right to say&mdash;&ldquo;But
these are subjects which can hardly be taught to young women in
public lectures;&rdquo; I rejoin&mdash;of course not, unless they
are taught by women&mdash;by women, of course, duly educated and
legally qualified.&nbsp; Let such teach to women, what every
woman ought to know, and what her parents will very properly
object to her hearing from almost any man.&nbsp; This is one of
the main reasons why I have, for twenty years past, advocated the
training of women for the medical profession; and one which
countervails, in my mind, all possible objections to such a
movement.&nbsp; And now, thank God, we are seeing the common
sense of Great Britain, and indeed of every civilised nation,
gradually coming round to that which seemed to me, when I first
conceived of it, a dream too chimerical to be cherished save in
secret&mdash;the restoring woman to her natural share in that
sacred office of healer, which she held in the Middle Ages, and
from which she was thrust out during the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>I am most happy to see, for instance, that the National Health
Society, <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> which I earnestly recommend to the
attention of my readers, announces a &ldquo;Course of Lectures
for Ladies on Elementary Physiology and Hygiene,&rdquo; by a
lady, to which I am also most happy to see, governesses are
admitted at half-fees.&nbsp; Alas! how much misery, disease, and
even death might have been prevented, had governesses been taught
such matters thirty years ago, I, for one, know too well.&nbsp;
May the day soon come when there will be educated women enough to
give such lectures throughout these realms, to rich as well as
poor&mdash;for the rich, strange to say, need them often as much
as the poor do&mdash;and that we may live to see, in every great
town, health classes for women as well as for men, sending forth
year by year more young women and young men taught, not only to
take care of themselves and of their families, but to exercise
moral influence over their fellow-citizens, as champions in the
battle against dirt and drunkenness, disease and death.</p>
<p>There may be those who would answer&mdash;or rather, there
would certainly have been those who would have so answered thirty
years ago, before the so-called materialism of advanced science
had taught us some practical wisdom about education, and reminded
people that they have bodies as well as minds and
souls&mdash;&ldquo;You say, we are likely to grow weaklier,
unhealthier.&nbsp; And if it were so, what matter?&nbsp; Mind
makes the man, not body.&nbsp; We do not want our children to be
stupid giants and bravos; but clever, able, highly educated,
however weakly Providence or the laws of nature may have chosen
to make them.&nbsp; Let them overstrain their brains a little;
let them contract their chests, and injure their digestion and
their eyesight, by sitting at desks, poring over books.&nbsp;
Intellect is what we want.&nbsp; Intellect makes money.&nbsp;
Intellect makes the world.&nbsp; We would rather see our son a
genius than a mere athlete.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well: and so would
I.&nbsp; But what if intellect alone does not even make money,
save as Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, Sampson Brass, and Montagu Tigg
were wont to make it, unless backed by an able, enduring, healthy
physique, such as I have seen, almost without exception, in those
successful men of business whom I have had the honour and the
pleasure of knowing?&nbsp; What if intellect, or what is now
called intellect, did not make the world, or the smallest wheel
or cog of it?&nbsp; What if, for want of obeying the laws of
nature, parents bred up neither a genius nor an athlete, but only
an incapable unhappy personage, with a huge upright forehead,
like that of a Byzantine Greek, filled with some sort of pap
instead of brains, and tempted alternately to fanaticism and
strong drink?&nbsp; We must, in the great majority of cases, have
the <i>corpus sanem</i> if we want the <i>mentem sanem</i>; and
healthy bodies are the only trustworthy organs for healthy
minds.&nbsp; Which is cause and which is effect, I shall not stay
to debate here.&nbsp; But wherever we find a population generally
weakly, stunted, scrofulous, we find in them a corresponding type
of brain, which cannot be trusted to do good work; which is
capable more or less of madness, whether solitary or
epidemic.&nbsp; It may be very active; it may be very quick at
catching at new and grand ideas&mdash;all the more quick,
perhaps, on account of its own secret malaise and
self-discontent; but it will be irritable, spasmodic,
hysterical.&nbsp; It will be apt to mistake capacity of talk for
capacity of action, excitement for earnestness, virulence for
force, and, too often; cruelty for justice.&nbsp; It will lose
manful independence, individuality, originality; and when men
act, they will act from the consciousness of personal weakness,
like sheep rushing over a hedge, leaning against each other,
exhorting each other to be brave, and swaying about in mobs and
masses.&nbsp; These were the intellectual weaknesses which, as I
read history, followed on physical degradation in Imperial Rome,
in Alexandria, in Byzantium.&nbsp; Have we not seen them
reappear, under fearful forms, in Paris but the other day?</p>
<p>I do not blame; I do not judge.&nbsp; My theory, which I hold,
and shall hold, to be fairly founded on a wide induction, forbids
me to blame and to judge; because it tells me that these defects
are mainly physical; that those who exhibit them are mainly to be
pitied, as victims of the sins or ignorance of their
forefathers.</p>
<p>But it tells me too, that those who, professing to be educated
men, and therefore bound to know better, treat these physical
phenomena as spiritual, healthy, and praiseworthy; who even
exasperate them, that they may make capital out of the weaknesses
of fallen man, are the most contemptible and yet the most
dangerous of public enemies, let them cloak their quackery under
whatsoever patriotic, or scientific, or even sacred words.</p>
<p>There are those again honest, kindly, sensible, practical men,
many of them; men whom I have no wish to offend; whom I had
rather ask to teach me some of their own experience and common
sense, which has learned to discern, like good statesmen, not
only what ought to be done, but what can be done&mdash;there are
those, I say, who would sooner see this whole question let
alone.&nbsp; Their feeling, as far as I can analyse it, seems to
be that the evils of which I have been complaining, are on the
whole inevitable; or, if not, that we can mend so very little of
them, that it is wisest to leave them alone altogether, lest,
like certain sewers, &ldquo;the more you stir them, the more they
smell.&rdquo;&nbsp; They fear lest we should unsettle the minds
of the many for whom these evils will never be mended; lest we
make them discontented; discontented with their houses, their
occupations, their food, their whole social arrangements; and all
in vain.</p>
<p>I should answer, in all courtesy and humility&mdash;for I
sympathise deeply with such men and women, and respect them
deeply likewise&mdash;but are not people discontented already,
from the lowest to the highest?&nbsp; And ought a man, in such a
piecemeal, foolish, greedy, sinful world as this is, and always
has been, to be anything but discontented?&nbsp; If he thinks
that things are going all right, must he not have a most beggarly
conception of what going right means?&nbsp; And if things are not
going right, can it be anything but good for him to see that they
are not going right?&nbsp; Can truth and fact harm any human
being?&nbsp; I shall not believe so, as long as I have a Bible
wherein to believe.&nbsp; For my part, I should like to make
every man, woman, and child whom I meet discontented with
themselves, even as I am discontented with myself.&nbsp; I should
like to awaken in them, about their physical, their intellectual,
their moral condition, that divine discontent which is the
parent, first of upward aspiration and then of self-control,
thought, effort to fulfil that aspiration even in part.&nbsp; For
to be discontented with the divine discontent, and to be ashamed
with the noble shame, is the very germ and first upgrowth of all
virtue.&nbsp; Men begin at first, as boys begin when they grumble
at their school and their schoolmasters, to lay the blame on
others; to be discontented with their circumstances&mdash;the
things which stand around them; and to cry, &ldquo;Oh that I had
this!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had that!&rdquo;&nbsp; But by
that way no deliverance lies.&nbsp; That discontent only ends in
revolt and rebellion, social or political; and that, again, still
in the same worship of circumstances&mdash;but this time
desperate&mdash;which ends, let it disguise itself under what
fine names it will, in what the old Greeks called a tyranny; in
which&mdash;as in the Spanish republics of America, and in France
more than once&mdash;all have become the voluntary slaves of one
man, because each man fancies that the one man can improve his
circumstances for him.</p>
<p>But the wise man will learn, like Epictetus the heroic slave,
the slave of Epaphroditus, Nero&rsquo;s minion&mdash;and in what
baser and uglier circumstances could human being find
himself?&mdash;to find out the secret of being truly free;
namely, to be discontented with no man and no thing save
himself.&nbsp; To say not&mdash;&ldquo;Oh that I had this and
that!&rdquo; but &ldquo;Oh that I were this and
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, by God&rsquo;s help&mdash;and that
heroic slave, heathen though he was, believed and trusted in
God&rsquo;s help&mdash;&ldquo;I will make myself that which God
has shown me that I ought to be and can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand a year, or ten million a year, as Epictetus saw
full well, cannot mend that vulgar discontent with circumstances
which he had felt&mdash;and who with more right?&mdash;and
conquered, and despised.&nbsp; For that is the discontent of
children, wanting always more holidays and more sweets.&nbsp; But
I wish my readers to have, and to cherish, the discontent of men
and women.</p>
<p>Therefore I would make men and women discontented, with the
divine and wholesome discontent, at their own physical frame, and
at that of their children.&nbsp; I would accustom their eyes to
those precious heirlooms of the human race, the statues of the
old Greeks; to their tender grandeur, their chaste healthfulness,
their unconscious, because perfect might: and say&mdash;There;
these are tokens to you, and to all generations yet unborn, of
what man could be once; of what he can be again if he will obey
those laws of nature which are the voice of God.&nbsp; I would
make them discontented with the ugliness and closeness of their
dwellings; I would make them discontented with the fashion of
their garments, and still more just now the women, of all ranks,
with the fashion of theirs; and with everything around them which
they have the power of improving, if it be at all ungraceful,
superfluous, tawdry, ridiculous, unwholesome.&nbsp; I would make
them discontented with what they call their education, and say to
them&mdash;You call the three Royal R&rsquo;s education?&nbsp;
They are not education: no more is the knowledge which would
enable you to take the highest prizes given by the Society of
Arts, or any other body.&nbsp; They are not education: they are
only instruction; a necessary groundwork, in an age like this,
for making practical use of your education: but not the education
itself.</p>
<p>And if they asked me, What then education meant? I should
point them, first, I think, to noble old Lilly&rsquo;s noble old
&ldquo;Euphues,&rdquo; of three hundred years ago, and ask them
to consider what it says about education, and especially this
passage concerning that mere knowledge which is nowadays
strangely miscalled education.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are two
principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and
reason.&nbsp; The one&rdquo;&mdash;that is
reason&mdash;&ldquo;commandeth, and the other&rdquo;&mdash;that
is knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;obeyeth.&nbsp; These things neither the
whirling wheel of fortune can change, nor the deceitful
cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, nor
age abolish.&rdquo;&nbsp; And next I should point them to those
pages in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Juventus Mundi,&rdquo;
where he describes the ideal training of a Greek youth in
Homer&rsquo;s days; and say&mdash;There: that is an education fit
for a really civilised man, even though he never saw a book in
his life; the full, proportionate, harmonious educing-that is,
bringing out and developing&mdash;of all the faculties of his
body, mind, and heart, till he becomes at once a reverent yet
self-assured, a graceful and yet a valiant, an able and yet an
eloquent personage.</p>
<p>And if any should say to me&mdash;&ldquo;But what has this to
do with science?&nbsp; Homer&rsquo;s Greeks knew no
science;&rdquo; I should rejoin&mdash;But they had, pre-eminently
above all ancient races which we know, the scientific instinct;
the teachableness and modesty; the clear eye and quick ear; the
hearty reverence for fact and nature, and for the human body, and
mind, and spirit; for human nature in a word, in its
completeness, as the highest fact upon this earth.&nbsp;
Therefore they became in after years, not only the great
colonisers and the great civilisers of the old world&mdash;the
most practical people, I hold, which the world ever saw; but the
parents of all sound physics as well as of all sound
metaphysics.&nbsp; Their very religion, in spite of its
imperfections, helped forward their education, not in spite of,
but by means of that anthropomorphism which we sometimes too
hastily decry.&nbsp; As Mr. Gladstone says: &ldquo;As regarded
all other functions of our nature, outside the domain of the life
to Godward&mdash;all those functions which are summed up in what
St. Paul calls the flesh and the mind, the psychic and bodily
life, the tendency of the system was to exalt the human element,
by proposing a model of beauty, strength, and wisdom, in all
their combinations, so elevated that the effort to attain them
required a continual upward strain.&nbsp; It made divinity
attainable; and thus it effectually directed the thought and aim
of man</p>
<blockquote><p>Along the line of limitless desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a scheme of religion, though failing grossly in the
government of the passions, and in upholding the standard of
moral duties, tended powerfully to produce a lofty self-respect,
and a large, free, and varied conception of humanity.&nbsp; It
incorporated itself in schemes of notable discipline for mind and
body, indeed of a lifelong education; and these habits of mind
and action had their marked results (to omit many other
greatnesses) in a philosophy, literature, and art, which remain
to this day unrivalled or unsurpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much those old Greeks did for their own education, without
science and without Christianity.&nbsp; We who have both: what
might we not do, if we would be true to our advantages, and to
ourselves?</p>
<h2><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>THE
TWO BREATHS <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ladies</span>,&mdash;I have been honoured
by a second invitation to address you, and I dare not refuse it;
because it gives me an opportunity of speaking on a matter,
knowledge and ignorance about which may seriously affect your
health and happiness, and that of the children with whom you may
have to do.&nbsp; I must apologise if I say many things which are
well known to many persons in this room: they ought to be well
known to all: but it is generally best to assume total ignorance
in one&rsquo;s hearers, and to begin from the beginning.</p>
<p>I shall try to be as simple as possible; to trouble you as
little as possible with scientific terms; to be practical; and at
the same time, if possible, interesting.</p>
<p>I should wish to call this lecture &ldquo;The Two
Breaths:&rdquo; not merely &ldquo;The Breath;&rdquo; and for this
reason: every time you breathe you breathe two different breaths;
you take in one, you give out another.&nbsp; The composition of
those two breaths is different.&nbsp; Their effects are
different.&nbsp; The breath which has been breathed out must not
be breathed in again.&nbsp; To tell you why it must not would
lead me into anatomical details, not quite in place here as yet;
though the day will come, I trust, when every woman entrusted
with the care of children will be expected to know something
about them.&nbsp; But this I may say: Those who habitually take
in fresh breath will probably grow up large, strong, ruddy,
cheerful, active, clear-headed, fit for their work.&nbsp; Those
who habitually take in the breath which has been breathed out by
themselves, or any other living creature, will certainly grow up,
if they grow up at all, small, weak, pale, nervous, depressed,
unfit for work, and tempted continually to resort to stimulants,
and become drunkards.</p>
<p>If you want to see how different the breath breathed out is
from the breath taken in, you have only to try a somewhat cruel
experiment, but one which people too often try upon themselves,
their children, and their workpeople.&nbsp; If you take any small
animal with lungs like your own&mdash;a mouse, for
instance&mdash;and force it to breathe no air but what you have
breathed already; if you put it in a close box, and while you
take in breath from the outer air, send out your breath through a
tube, into that box, the animal will soon faint: if you go on
long with this process, it will die.</p>
<p>Take a second instance, which I beg to press most seriously on
the notice of mothers, governesses, and nurses.&nbsp; If you
allow a child to get into the habit of sleeping with its head
under the bed-clothes, and thereby breathing its own breath over
and over again, that child will assuredly grow pale, weak, and
ill.&nbsp; Medical men have cases on record of scrofula appearing
in children previously healthy, which could only be accounted for
from this habit, and which ceased when the habit stopped.&nbsp;
Let me again entreat your attention to this undoubted fact.</p>
<p>Take another instance, which is only too common: If you are in
a crowded room, with plenty of fire and lights and company, doors
and windows all shut tight, how often you feel faint&mdash;so
faint that you may require smelling-salts or some other
stimulant.&nbsp; The cause of your faintness is just the same as
that of the mouse&rsquo;s fainting in the box; you and your
friends, and, as I shall show you presently, the fire and the
candles likewise, having been all breathing each other&rsquo;s
breaths, over and over again, till the air has become unfit to
support life.&nbsp; You are doing your best to enact over again
the Highland tragedy, of which Sir James Simpson tells in his
lectures to the working-classes of Edinburgh, when at a Christmas
meeting thirty-six persons danced all night in a small room with
a low ceiling, keeping the doors and windows shut.&nbsp; The
atmosphere of the room was noxious beyond description; and the
effect was, that seven of the party were soon after seized with
typhus fever, of which two died.&nbsp; You are inflicting on
yourselves the torments of the poor dog, who is kept at the
Grotto del Cane, near Naples, to be stupefied, for the amusement
of visitors, by the carbonic acid gas of the Grotto, and brought
to life again by being dragged into the fresh air; nay, you are
inflicting upon yourselves the torments of the famous Black Hole
of Calcutta: and, if there was no chimney in the room, by which
some fresh air could enter, the candles would soon burn blue, as
they do, you know, when ghosts appear; your brains become
disturbed; and you yourselves ran the risk of becoming ghosts,
and the candles of actually going out.</p>
<p>Of this last fact there is no doubt; for if, instead of
putting a mouse into the box, you will put a lighted candle, and
breathe into the tube as before, however gently, you will in a
short time put the candle out.</p>
<p>Now, how is this?&nbsp; First, what is the difference between
the breath you take in and the breath you give out?&nbsp; And
next, why has it a similar effect on animal life and a lighted
candle?</p>
<p>The difference is this.&nbsp; The breath which you take in is,
or ought to be, pure air, composed, on the whole, of oxygen and
nitrogen, with a minute portion of carbonic acid.</p>
<p>The breath which you give out is an impure air, to which has
been added, among other matters which will not support life, an
excess of carbonic acid.</p>
<p>That this is the fact you can prove for yourselves by a simple
experiment.&nbsp; Get a little lime-water at the chemist&rsquo;s,
and breathe into it through a glass tube; your breath will at
once make the lime-water milky.&nbsp; The carbonic acid of your
breath has laid hold of the lime, and made it visible as white
carbonate of lime&mdash;in plain English, as common chalk.</p>
<p>Now I do not wish, as I said, to load your memories with
scientific terms: but I beseech you to remember at least these
two, oxygen gas and carbonic acid gas; and to remember that, as
surely as oxygen feeds the fire of life, so surely does carbonic
acid put it out.</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;the fire of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that
expression lies the answer to our second question: Why does our
breath produce a similar effect upon the mouse and the lighted
candle?&nbsp; Every one of us is, as it were, a living
fire.&nbsp; Were we not, how could we be always warmer than the
air outside us?&nbsp; There is a process; going on perpetually in
each of us, similar to that by which coals are burnt in the fire,
oil in a lamp, wax in a candle, and the earth itself in a
volcano.&nbsp; To keep each of those fires alight, oxygen is
needed; and the products of combustion, as they are called, are
more or less the same in each case&mdash;carbonic acid and
steam.</p>
<p>These facts justify the expression I just made use
of&mdash;which may have seemed to some of you
fantastical&mdash;that the fire and the candles in the crowded
room were breathing the same breath as you were.&nbsp; It is but
too true.&nbsp; An average fire in the grate requires, to keep it
burning, as much oxygen as several human beings do; each candle
or lamp must have its share of oxygen likewise, and that a very
considerable one, and an average gas-burner&mdash;pray attend to
this, you who live in rooms lighted with gas&mdash;consumes as
much oxygen as several candles.&nbsp; All alike are making
carbonic acid.&nbsp; The carbonic acid of the fire happily
escapes up the chimney in the smoke: but the carbonic acid from
the human beings and the candles remains to poison the room,
unless it be ventilated.</p>
<p>Now, I think you may understand one of the simplest, and yet
most terrible, cases of want of ventilation&mdash;death by the
fumes of charcoal.&nbsp; A human being shut up in a room, of
which every crack is closed, with a pan of burning charcoal,
falls asleep, never to wake again.&nbsp; His inward fire is
competing with the fire of charcoal for the oxygen of the room;
both are making carbonic acid out of it: but the charcoal, being
the stronger of the two, gets all the oxygen to itself, and
leaves the human being nothing to inhale but the carbonic acid
which it has made.&nbsp; The human being, being the weaker, dies
first: but the charcoal dies also.&nbsp; When it has exhausted
all the oxygen of the room, it cools, goes out, and is found in
the morning half-consumed beside its victim.&nbsp; If you put a
giant or an elephant, I should conceive, into that room, instead
of a human being, the case would be reversed for a time: the
elephant would put out the burning charcoal by the carbonic acid
from his mighty lungs; and then, when he had exhausted all the
air in the room, die likewise of his own carbonic acid.</p>
<p>Now, I think, we may see what ventilation means, and why it is
needed.</p>
<p>Ventilation means simply letting out the foul air, and letting
in the fresh air; letting out the air which has been breathed by
men or by candles, and letting in the air which has not.&nbsp; To
understand how to do that, we must remember a most simple
chemical law, that a gas as it is warmed expands, and therefore
becomes lighter; as it cools, it contracts, and becomes
heavier.</p>
<p>Now the carbonic acid in the breath which comes out of our
mouth is warm, lighter than the air, and rises to the ceiling;
and therefore in any unventilated room full of people, there is a
layer of foul air along the ceiling.&nbsp; You might soon test
that for yourselves, if you could mount a ladder and put your
heads there aloft.&nbsp; You do test it for yourselves when you
sit in the galleries of churches and theatres, where the air is
palpably more foul, and therefore more injurious, than down
below.</p>
<p>Where, again, work-people are employed in a crowded house of
many storeys, the health of those who work on the upper floors
always suffers most.</p>
<p>In the old monkey-house of the Zoological Gardens, when the
cages were on the old plan, tier upon tier, the poor little
fellows in the uppermost tier&mdash;so I have been
told&mdash;always died first of the monkey&rsquo;s constitutional
complaint, consumption, simply from breathing the warm breath of
their friends below.&nbsp; But since the cages have been altered,
and made to range side by side from top to bottom,
consumption&mdash;I understand&mdash;has vastly diminished among
them.</p>
<p>The first question in ventilation, therefore, is to get this
carbonic acid safe out of the room, while it is warm and light
and close to the ceiling; for if you do not, this happens: The
carbonic acid gas cools and becomes heavier; for carbonic acid,
at the same temperature as common air, is so much heavier than
common air, that you may actually&mdash;if you are handy
enough&mdash;turn it from one vessel to another, and pour out for
your enemy a glass of invisible poison.&nbsp; So down to the
floor this heavy carbonic acid comes, and lies along it, just as
it lies often in the bottom of old wells, or old brewers&rsquo;
vats, as a stratum of poison, killing occasionally the men who
descend into it.&nbsp; Hence, as foolish a practice as I know is
that of sleeping on the floor; for towards the small hours, when
the room gets cold, the sleeper on the floor is breathing
carbonic acid.</p>
<p>And here one word to those ladies who interest themselves with
the poor.&nbsp; The poor are too apt in times of distress to pawn
their bedsteads and keep their beds.&nbsp; Never, if you have
influence, let that happen.&nbsp; Keep the bedstead, whatever
else may go, to save the sleeper from the carbonic acid on the
floor.</p>
<p>How, then, shall we get rid of the foul air at the top of the
room?&nbsp; After all that has been written and tried on
ventilation, I know no simpler method than putting into the
chimney one of Arnott&rsquo;s ventilators, which may be bought
and fixed for a few shillings; always remembering that it must
be. fixed into the chimney as near the ceiling as possible.&nbsp;
I can speak of these ventilators from twenty-five years&rsquo;
experience.&nbsp; Living in a house with low ceilings, liable to
become overcharged with carbonic acid, which produces sleepiness
in the evening, I have found that these ventilators keep the air
fresh and pure; and I consider the presence of one of these
ventilators in a room more valuable than three or four feet
additional height of ceiling.&nbsp; I have found, too, that their
working proves how necessary they are, from this simple fact: You
would suppose that, as the ventilator opens freely into the
chimney, the smoke would be blown down through it in high winds,
and blacken the ceiling: but this is just what does not
happen.&nbsp; If the ventilator be at all properly poised, so as
to shut with a violent gust of wind, it will at all other moments
keep itself permanently open; proving thereby that there is an
up-draught of heated air continually escaping from the ceiling up
the chimney.&nbsp; Another very simple method of ventilation is
employed in those excellent cottages which Her Majesty has built
for her labourers round Windsor.&nbsp; Over each door a sheet of
perforated zinc, some eighteen inches square, is fixed; allowing
the foul air to escape into the passage; and in the ceiling of
the passage a similar sheet of zinc, allowing it to escape into
the roof.&nbsp; Fresh air, meanwhile, should be obtained from
outside, by piercing the windows, or otherwise.&nbsp; And here
let me give one hint to all builders of houses: If possible, let
bedroom windows open at the top as well as at the bottom.</p>
<p>Let me impress the necessity of using some such contrivances,
not only on parents and educators, but on those who employ
workpeople, and above all on those who employ young women in
shops or in work-rooms.&nbsp; What their condition may be in this
city I know not; but most painful it has been to me in other
places, when passing through warehouses or workrooms, to see the
pale, sodden, and, as the French would say,
&ldquo;etiolated&rdquo; countenances of the girls who were
passing the greater part of the day in them; and painful, also,
to breathe an atmosphere of which habit had, alas! made them
unconscious, but which to one coming out of the open air was
altogether noxious, and shocking also; for it was fostering the
seeds of death, not only in the present but future
generations.</p>
<p>Why should this be?&nbsp; Everyone will agree that good
ventilation is necessary in a hospital, because people cannot get
well without fresh air.&nbsp; Do they not see that by the same
reasoning good ventilation is necessary everywhere, because
people cannot remain well without fresh air?&nbsp; Let me entreat
those who employ women in workrooms, if they have no time to read
through such books as Dr. Andrew Combe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Physiology
applied to Health and Education,&rdquo; and Madame de
Wahl&rsquo;s &ldquo;Practical Hints on the Moral, Mental, and
Physical Training of Girls,&rdquo; to procure certain tracts
published by Messrs. Jarrold, Paternoster Row, for the
Ladies&rsquo; Sanitary Association; especially one which bears on
this subject: &ldquo;The Black-hole in our own Bedrooms;&rdquo;
Dr. Lankester&rsquo;s &ldquo;School Manual of Health;&rdquo; or a
manual on ventilation, published by the Metropolitan Working
Classes Association for the Improvement of Public Health.</p>
<p>I look forward&mdash;I say it openly&mdash;to some period of
higher civilisation, when the Acts of Parliament for the
ventilation of factories and workshops shall be largely extended,
and made far more stringent; when officers of public health shall
be empowered to enforce the ventilation of every room in which
persons are employed for hire: and empowered also to demand a
proper system of ventilation for every new house, whether in
country or in town.&nbsp; To that, I believe, we must come: but I
had sooner far see these improvements carried out, as befits the
citizens of a free country, in the spirit of the Gospel rather
than in that of the Law; carried out, not compulsorily and from
fear of fines, but voluntarily, from a sense of duty, honour, and
humanity.&nbsp; I appeal, therefore, to the good feeling of all
whom it may concern, whether the health of those whom they
employ, and therefore the supply of fresh air which they
absolutely need, are not matters for which they are not, more or
less, responsible to their country and their God.</p>
<p>And if any excellent person of the old school should answer
me: &ldquo;Why make all this fuss about ventilation?&nbsp; Our
forefathers got on very well without it&rdquo;&mdash;I must
answer that, begging their pardons, our ancestors did nothing of
the kind.&nbsp; Our ancestors got on usually very ill in these
matters: and when they got on well, it was because they had good
ventilation in spite of themselves.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; They got on very ill.&nbsp; To quote a few
remarkable instances of longevity, or to tell me that men were
larger and stronger on the average in old times, is to yield to
the old fallacy of fancying that savages were peculiarly healthy,
because those who were seen were active and strong.&nbsp; The
simple answer is, that the strong alone survived, while the
majority died from the severity of the training.&nbsp; Savages do
not increase in number; and our ancestors increased but very
slowly for many centuries.&nbsp; I am not going to disgust my
audience with statistics of disease: but knowing something, as I
happen to do, of the social state and of the health of the Middle
and Elizabethan Ages, I have no hesitation in saying that the
average of disease and death was far greater then than it is
now.&nbsp; Epidemics of many kinds, typhus, ague,
plague&mdash;all diseases which were caused more or less by bad
air&mdash;devastated this land and Europe in those days with a
horrible intensity, to which even the choleras of our times are
mild.&nbsp; The back streets, the hospitals, the gaols, the
barracks, the camps&mdash;every place in which any large number
of persons congregated, were so many nests of pestilence,
engendered by uncleanliness, which defiled alike the water which
was drunk and the air which was breathed; and as a single fact,
of which the tables of insurance companies assure us, the average
of human life in England has increased twenty-five per cent.
since the reign of George I., owing simply to our more rational
and cleanly habits of life.</p>
<p>But secondly, I said that when our ancestors got on well, they
did so because they got ventilation in spite of themselves.&nbsp;
Luckily for them, their houses were ill-built; their doors and
windows would not shut.&nbsp; They had lattice-windowed houses,
too; to live in one of which, as I can testify from long
experience, is as thoroughly ventilating as living in a lantern
with the horn broken out.&nbsp; It was because their houses were
full of draughts, and still more, in the early Middle Age,
because they had no glass, and stopped out the air only by a
shutter at night, that they sought for shelter rather than for
fresh air, of which they sometimes had too much; and, to escape
the wind, built their houses in holes, such as that in which the
old city of Winchester stands.&nbsp; Shelter, I believe, as much
as the desire to be near fish in Lent, and to occupy the rich
alluvium of the valleys, made the monks of Old England choose the
river-banks for the sites of their abbeys.&nbsp; They made a
mistake therein, which, like most mistakes, did not go
unpunished.&nbsp; These low situations, especially while the
forests were yet thick on the hills around, were the perennial
haunts of fever and ague, produced by subtle vegetable poisons,
carried in the carbonic acid given off by rotten
vegetation.&nbsp; So there, again, they fell in with man&rsquo;s
old enemy&mdash;bad air.&nbsp; Still, as long as the doors and
windows did not shut, some free circulation of air
remained.&nbsp; But now, our doors and windows shut only too
tight.&nbsp; We have plate-glass instead of lattices; and we have
replaced the draughty and smoky, but really wholesome open
chimney, with its wide corners and settles, by narrow registers,
and even by stoves.&nbsp; We have done all we can, in fact, to
seal ourselves up hermetically from the outer air, and to breath
our own breaths over and over again; and we pay the penalty of it
in a thousand ways unknown to our ancestors, through whose rooms
all the winds of heaven whistled, and who were glad enough to
shelter themselves from draughts in the sitting-room by the high
screen round the fire, and in the sleeping-room by the thick
curtains of the four-post bedstead, which is now rapidly
disappearing before a higher civilisation.&nbsp; We therefore
absolutely require to make for ourselves the very ventilation
from which our ancestors tried to escape.</p>
<p>But, ladies, there is an old and true proverb, that you may
bring a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.&nbsp;
And in like wise it is too true, that you may bring people to the
fresh air, but you cannot make them breath it.&nbsp; Their own
folly, or the folly of their parents and educators, prevents
their lungs being duly filled and duly emptied.&nbsp; Therefore
the blood is not duly oxygenated, and the whole system goes
wrong.&nbsp; Paleness, weakness, consumption, scrofula, and too
many other ailments, are the consequences of ill-filled
lungs.&nbsp; For without well-filled lungs, robust health is
impossible.</p>
<p>And if anyone shall answer: &ldquo;We do not want robust
health so much as intellectual attainment; the mortal body, being
the lower organ, must take its chance, and be even sacrificed, if
need be to the higher organ&mdash;the immortal
mind&rdquo;&mdash;To such I reply, You cannot do it.&nbsp; The
laws of nature, which are the express will of God, laugh such
attempts to scorn.&nbsp; Every organ of the body is formed out of
the blood; and if the blood be vitiated, every organ suffers in
proportion to its delicacy; and the brain, being the most
delicate and highly specialised of all organs, suffers most of
all, and soonest of all, as everyone knows who has tried to work
his brain when his digestion was the least out of order.&nbsp;
Nay, the very morals will suffer.&nbsp; From ill-filled lungs,
which signify ill-repaired blood, arise year by year an amount
not merely of disease, but of folly, temper, laziness,
intemperance, madness, and, let me tell you fairly,
crime&mdash;the sum of which will never be known till that great
day when men shall be called to account for all deeds done in the
body, whether they be good or evil.</p>
<p>I must refer you on this subject again to Andrew Combe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Physiology,&rdquo; especially chapters iv. and vii.; and
also to chapter x. of Madame de Wahl&rsquo;s excellent
book.&nbsp; I will only say this shortly, that the three most
common causes of ill-filled lungs, in children and in young
ladies, are stillness, silence, and stays.</p>
<p>First, stillness; a sedentary life, and want of
exercise.&nbsp; A girl is kept for hours sitting on a form
writing or reading, to do which she must lean forward; and if her
schoolmistress cruelly attempts to make her sit upright, and
thereby keep the spine in an attitude for which Nature did not
intend it, she is thereby doing her best to bring on that
disease, so fearfully common in girls&rsquo; schools, lateral
curvature of the spine.&nbsp; But practically the girl will stoop
forward.&nbsp; And what happens?&nbsp; The lower ribs are pressed
into the body, thereby displacing more or less something
inside.&nbsp; The diaphragm in the meantime, which is the very
bellows of the lungs, remains loose; the lungs are never properly
filled or emptied; and an excess of carbonic acid accumulates at
the bottom of them.&nbsp; What follows?&nbsp; Frequent sighing to
get rid of it; heaviness of head; depression of the whole nervous
system under the influence of the poison of the lungs; and when
the poor child gets up from her weary work, what is the first
thing she probably does?&nbsp; She lifts up her chest, stretches,
yawns, and breathes deeply&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s voice,
Nature&rsquo;s instinctive cure, which is probably regarded as
ungraceful, as what is called &ldquo;lolling&rdquo; is.&nbsp; As
if sitting upright was not an attitude in itself essentially
ungraceful, and such as no artist would care to draw.&nbsp; As if
&ldquo;lolling,&rdquo; which means putting the body in the
attitude of the most perfect ease compatible with a
fully-expanded chest, was not in itself essentially graceful, and
to be seen in every reposing figure in Greek bas-reliefs and
vases; graceful, and like all graceful actions, healthful at the
same time.&nbsp; The only tolerably wholesome attitude of repose,
which I see allowed in average school-rooms, is lying on the back
on the floor, or on a sloping board, in which case the lungs must
be fully expanded.&nbsp; But even so, a pillow, or some
equivalent, ought to be placed under the small of the back: or
the spine will be strained at its very weakest point.</p>
<p>I now go on to the second mistake&mdash;enforced
silence.&nbsp; Moderate reading aloud is good: but where there is
any tendency to irritability of throat or lungs, too much
moderation cannot be used.&nbsp; You may as well try to cure a
diseased lung by working it, as to cure a lame horse by galloping
him.&nbsp; But where the breathing organs are of average health
let it be said once and for all, that children and young people
cannot make too much noise.&nbsp; The parents who cannot bear the
noise of their children have no right to have brought them into
the world.&nbsp; The schoolmistress who enforces silence on her
pupils is committing&mdash;unintentionally no doubt, but still
committing&mdash;an offence against reason, worthy only of a
convent.&nbsp; Every shout, every burst of laughter, every
song&mdash;nay, in the case of infants, as physiologists well
know, every moderate fit of crying&mdash;conduces to health, by
rapidly filling and emptying the lung, and changing the blood
more rapidly from black to red, that is, from death to
life.&nbsp; Andrew Combe tells a story of a large charity school,
in which the young girls were, for the sake of their health, shut
up in the hall and school-room during play hours, from November
till March, and no romping or noise allowed.&nbsp; The natural
consequences were, the great majority of them fell ill; and I am
afraid that a great deal of illness has been from time to time
contracted in certain school-rooms, simply through this one cause
of enforced silence.&nbsp; Some cause or other there must be for
the amount of ill-health and weakliness which prevails especially
among girls of the middle classes in towns, who have not, poor
things, the opportunities which richer girls have, of keeping
themselves in strong health by riding, skating,
archery,&mdash;that last quite an admirable exercise for the
chest and lungs, and far preferable to croquet, which involves
too much unwholesome stooping.&mdash;Even a game of ball, if
milliners and shop-girls had room to indulge in one after their
sedentary work, might bring fresh spirits to many a heart, and
fresh colour to many a cheek.</p>
<p>I spoke just now of the Greeks.&nbsp; I suppose you will all
allow that the Greeks were, as far as we know, the most beautiful
race which the world ever saw.&nbsp; Every educated man knows
that they were also the cleverest of all races; and, next to his
Bible, thanks, God for Greek literature.</p>
<p>Now, these people had made physical as well as intellectual
education a science as well as a study.&nbsp; Their women
practised graceful, and in some cases even athletic,
exercises.&nbsp; They developed, by a free and healthy life,
those figures which remain everlasting and unapproachable models
of human beauty: but&mdash;to come to my third point&mdash;they
wore no stays.&nbsp; The first mention of stays that I have ever
found is in the letters of dear old Synesius, Bishop of Cyrene,
on the Greek coast of Africa, about four hundred years after the
Christian era.&nbsp; He tells us how, when he was shipwrecked on
a remote part of the coast, and he and the rest of the passengers
were starving on cockles and limpets, there was among them a
slave girl out of the far East, who had a pinched wasp-waist,
such as you may see on the old Hindoo sculptures, and such as you
may see in any street in a British town.&nbsp; And when the Greek
ladies of the neighbourhood found her out, they sent for her from
house to house, to behold, with astonishment and laughter, this
new and prodigious, waist, with which it seemed to them it was
impossible for a human being to breathe or live; and they petted
the poor girl, and fed her, as they might a dwarf or a giantess,
till she got quite fat and comfortable, while her owners had not
enough to eat.&nbsp; So strange and ridiculous seemed our present
fashion to the descendants of those who, centuries before, had
imagined, because they had seen living and moving, those glorious
statues which we pretend to admire, but refuse to imitate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a few centuries hence, when mankind has
learnt to fear God more, and therefore to obey more strictly
those laws of nature and of science which are the will of
God&mdash;it seems to me, I say, that in those days the present
fashion of tight lacing will be looked back upon as a
contemptible and barbarous superstition, denoting a very low
level of civilisation in the peoples which have practised
it.&nbsp; That for generations past women should have been in the
habit&mdash;not to please men, who do not care about the matter
as a point of beauty&mdash;but simply to vie with each other in
obedience to something called fashion&mdash;that they should, I
say, have been in the habit of deliberately crushing that part of
the body which should be specially left free, contracting and
displacing their lungs, their heart, and all the most vital and
important organs, and entailing thereby disease, not only on
themselves but on their children after them; that for forty years
past physicians should have been telling them of the folly of
what they have been doing; and that they should as yet, in the
great majority of cases, not only turn a deaf ear to all
warnings, but actually deny the offence, of which one glance of
the physician or the sculptor, who know what shape the human body
ought to be, brings them in guilty&mdash;this, I say, is an
instance of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;which deserves at
once the lash, not merely of the satirist, but of any theologian
who really believes that God made the physical universe.&nbsp;
Let me, I pray you, appeal to your common sense for a
moment.&nbsp; When any one chooses a horse or a dog, whether for
strength, for speed, or for any other useful purpose, the first
thing almost to be looked at is the girth round the ribs; the
room for heart and lungs.&nbsp; Exactly in proportion to that
will be the animal&rsquo;s general healthiness, power of
endurance, and value in many other ways.&nbsp; If you will look
at eminent lawyers and famous orators, who have attained a
healthy old age, you will see that in every case they are men,
like the late Lord Palmerston, and others whom I could mention,
of remarkable size, not merely in the upper, but in the lower
part of the chest; men who had, therefore, a peculiar power of
using the diaphragm to fill and to clear the lungs, and therefore
to oxygenate the blood of the whole body.&nbsp; Now, it is just
these lower ribs, across which the diaphragm is stretched like
the head of a drum, which stays contract to a minimum.&nbsp; If
you advised owners of horses and hounds to put their horses or
their hounds into stays, and lace them up tight, in order to
increase their beauty, you would receive, I doubt not, a very
courteous, but certainly a very decided, refusal to do that which
would spoil not merely the animals themselves, but the whole stud
or the whole kennel for years to come.&nbsp; And if you advised
an orator to put himself into tight stays, he, no doubt, again
would give a courteous answer; but he would reply&mdash;if he was
a really educated man&mdash;that to comply with your request
would involve his giving up public work, under the probable
penalty of being dead within the twelve-month.</p>
<p>And how much work of every kind, intellectual as well as
physical, is spoiled or hindered; how many deaths occur from
consumption and other complaints which are the result of this
habit of tight lacing, is known partly to the medical men, who
lift up their voices in vain, and known fully to Him who will not
interfere with the least of His own physical laws to save human
beings from the consequences of their own wilful folly.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;to end this lecture with more pleasing
thoughts&mdash;What becomes of this breath which passes from your
lips?&nbsp; Is it merely harmful; merely waste?&nbsp; God
forbid!&nbsp; God has forbidden that anything should be merely
harmful or merely waste in this so wise and well-made
world.&nbsp; The carbonic acid which passes from your lips at
every breath&mdash;ay, even that which oozes from the volcano
crater when the eruption is past&mdash;is a precious boon to
thousands of things of which you have daily need.&nbsp; Indeed
there is a sort of hint at physical truth in the old fairy tale
of the girl, from whose lips, as she spoke, fell pearls and
diamonds; for the carbonic acid of your breath may help hereafter
to make the pure carbonate of lime of a pearl, or the still purer
carbon of a diamond.&nbsp; Nay, it may go&mdash;in such a world
of transformations do we live&mdash;to make atoms of coal strata,
which after being buried for ages beneath deep seas, shall be
upheaved in continents which are yet unborn, and there be burnt
for the use of a future race of men, and resolved into their
original elements.&nbsp; Coal, wise men tell us, is on the whole
breath and sunlight; the breath of living creatures who have
lived in the vast swamps and forests of some primeval world, and
the sunlight which transmuted that breath into the leaves and
stems of trees, magically locked up for ages in that black stone,
to become, when it is burnt at last, light and carbonic acid as
it was at first.&nbsp; For though you must not breathe your
breath again, you may at least eat your breath, if you will allow
the sun to transmute it for you into vegetables; or you may enjoy
its fragrance and its colour in the shape of a lily or a
rose.&nbsp; When you walk in a sunlit garden, every word you
speak, every breath you breathe, is feeding the plants and
flowers around.&nbsp; The delicate surface of the green leaves
absorbs the carbonic acid, and parts it into its elements,
retaining the carbon to make woody fibre, and courteously
returning you the oxygen to mingle with the fresh air, and be
inhaled by your lungs once more.&nbsp; Thus do you feed the
plants; just as the plants feed you: while the great life-giving
sun feeds both; and the geranium standing in the sick
child&rsquo;s window does not merely rejoice his eye and mind by
its beauty and freshness, but repays honestly the trouble spent
on it; absorbing the breath which the child needs not, and giving
to him the breath which he needs.</p>
<p>So are the services of all things constituted according to a
Divine and wonderful order, and knit together in mutual
dependence and mutual helpfulness&mdash;a fact to be remembered
with hope and comfort: but also with awe and fear.&nbsp; For as
in that which is above nature, so in nature itself; he that
breaks one physical law is guilty of all.&nbsp; The whole
universe, as it were, takes up arms against him; and all nature,
with her numberless and unseen powers, is ready to avenge herself
on him, and on his children after him, he knows not when nor
where.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, who obeys the laws of nature
with his whole heart and mind, will find all things working
together to him for good.&nbsp; He is at peace with the physical
universe.&nbsp; He is helped and befriended alike by the sun
above his head and the dust beneath his feet; because he is
obeying the will and mind of Him who made sun, and dust, and all
things; and who has given them a law which cannot be broken.</p>

<a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ladies</span>,&mdash;I have chosen for the
title of this lecture a practical and prosaic word, because I
intend the lecture itself to be as practical and prosaic as I can
make it, without becoming altogether dull.</p>
<p>The question of the better or worse education of women is one
far too important for vague sentiment, wild aspirations, or
Utopian dreams.</p>
<p>It is a practical question, on which depends not merely money
or comfort, but too often health and life, as the consequences of
a good education, or disease and death&mdash;I know too well of
what I speak&mdash;as the consequences of a bad one.</p>
<p>I beg you, therefore, to put out of your minds at the outset
any fancy that I wish for a social revolution in the position of
women; or that I wish to see them educated by exactly the same
methods, and in exactly the same subjects, as men.&nbsp; British
lads, on an average, are far too ill-taught still, in spite of
all recent improvements, for me to wish that British girls should
be taught in the same way.</p>
<p>Moreover, whatever defects there may have been&mdash;and
defects there must be in all things human&mdash;in the past
education of British women, it has been most certainly a splendid
moral success.&nbsp; It has made, by the grace of God, British
women the best wives, mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, that
the world, as far as I can discover, has yet seen.</p>
<p>Let those who will, sneer at the women of England.&nbsp; We
who have to do the work and to fight the battle of life know the
inspiration which we derive from their virtue, their counsel,
their tenderness, and&mdash;but too often&mdash;from their
compassion and their forgiveness.&nbsp; There is, I doubt not,
still left in England many a man with chivalry and patriotism
enough to challenge the world to show so perfect a specimen of
humanity as a cultivated British woman.</p>
<p>But just because a cultivated British woman is so perfect a
personage; therefore I wish to see all British women
cultivated.&nbsp; Because the womanhood of England is so precious
a treasure; I wish to see none of it wasted.&nbsp; It is an
invaluable capital, or material, out of which the greatest
possible profit to the nation must be made.&nbsp; And that can
only be done by Thrift; and that, again, can only be attained by
knowledge.</p>
<p>Consider that word Thrift.&nbsp; If you will look at
&ldquo;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary,&rdquo; or if you know your
&ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; you will see that Thrift signified
originally profits, gain, riches gotten&mdash;in a word, the
marks of a man&rsquo;s thriving.</p>
<p>How, then, did the word Thrift get to mean parsimony,
frugality, the opposite of waste?&nbsp; Just in the same way as
economy&mdash;which first, of course, meant the management of a
household&mdash;got to mean also the opposite of waste.</p>
<p>It was found that in commerce, in husbandry, in any process,
in fact, men throve in proportion as they saved their capital,
their material, their force.</p>
<p>Now this is a great law which runs through life; one of those
laws of nature&mdash;call them, rather, laws of God&mdash;which
apply not merely to political economy, to commerce, and to
mechanics; but to physiology, to society; to the intellect, to
the heart, of every person in this room.</p>
<p>The secret of thriving is thrift; saving of force; to get as
much work as possible done with the least expenditure of power,
the least jar and obstruction, least wear and tear.</p>
<p>And the secret of thrift is knowledge.&nbsp; In proportion as
you know the laws and nature of a subject, you will be able to
work at it easily, surely, rapidly, successfully; instead of
wasting your money or your energies in mistaken schemes,
irregular efforts, which end in disappointment and
exhaustion.</p>
<p>The secret of thrift, I say, is knowledge.&nbsp; The more you
know, the more you can save yourself and that which belongs to
you; and can do more work with less effort.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the laws of commercial credit, we all know,
saves capital, enabling a less capital to do the work of a
greater.&nbsp; Knowledge of the electric telegraph saves time;
knowledge of writing saves human speech and locomotion; knowledge
of domestic economy saves income; knowledge of sanitary laws
saves health and life; knowledge of the laws of the intellect
saves wear and tear of brain; and knowledge of the laws of the
spirit&mdash;what does it not save?</p>
<p>A well-educated moral sense, a well-regulated character, saves
from idleness and ennui, alternating with sentimentality and
excitement, those tenderer emotions, those deeper passions, those
nobler aspirations of humanity, which are the heritage of the
woman far more than of the man; and which are potent in her, for
evil or for good, in proportion as they are left to run wild and
undisciplined; or are trained and developed into graceful,
harmonious, self-restraining strength, beautiful in themselves,
and a blessing to all who come under their influence.</p>
<p>What, therefore, I recommend to ladies in this lecture is
thrift: thrift of themselves and of their own powers: and
knowledge as the parent of thrift.</p>
<p>And because it is well to begin with the lower applications of
thrift, and to work up to the higher, I am much pleased to hear
that the first course of the proposed lectures to women in this
place will be one on domestic economy.</p>
<p>I presume that the learned gentleman who will deliver these
lectures will be the last to mean by that term the mere saving of
money; that he will tell you, as&mdash;being a German&mdash;he
will have good reason to know, that the young lady who learns
thrift in domestic economy is also learning thrift of the very
highest faculties of her immortal spirit.&nbsp; He will tell you,
I doubt not&mdash;for he must know&mdash;how you may see in
Germany young ladies living in what we more luxurious British
would consider something like poverty; cooking, waiting at table,
and performing many a household office which would be here
considered menial; and yet finding time for a cultivation of the
intellect, which is, unfortunately, too rare in Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The truth is, that we British are too wealthy.&nbsp; We make
money, if not too rapidly for the good of the nation at large,
yet too rapidly, I fear, for the good of the daughters of those
who make it.&nbsp; Their temptation&mdash;I do not, of course,
say they all yield to it&mdash;but their temptation is, to waste
of the very simplest&mdash;I had almost said, if I may be
pardoned the expression, of the most barbaric&mdash;kind; to an
oriental waste of money, and waste of time; to a fondness for
mere finery, pardonable enough, but still a waste; and to the
mistaken fancy that it is the mark of a lady to sit idle and let
servants do everything for her.</p>
<p>But it is not of this sort of waste of which I wish to speak
to-day.&nbsp; I only mention the matter in passing, to show that
high intellectual culture is not incompatible with the
performance of homely household duties, and that the moral
success of which I spoke just now need not be injured, any more
than it is in Germany, by intellectual success likewise.&nbsp; I
trust that these words may reassure those parents, if any such
there be here, who may fear that these lectures will withdraw
women from their existing sphere of interest and activity.&nbsp;
That they should entertain such a fear is not surprising, after
the extravagant opinions and schemes which have been lately
broached in various quarters.</p>
<p>The programme to these lectures expressly disclaims any such
intentions; and I, as a husband and a father, expressly disclaim
any such intention likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fit women for the more enlightened performance of
their special duties;&rdquo; to help them towards learning how to
do better what we doubt not many of them are already doing well;
is, I honestly believe, the only object of the promoters of this
scheme.</p>
<p>Let us see now how some of these special duties can be better
performed by help of a little enlightenment as to the laws which
regulate them.</p>
<p>Now, no man will deny&mdash;certainly no man who is past
forty-five, and whose digestion is beginning to quail before the
lumps of beef and mutton which are the boast of a British
kitchen, and to prefer, with Justice Shallow, and, I presume, Sir
John Falstaff also, &ldquo;any pretty little tiny
kickshaws&rdquo;&mdash;no man, I say, who has reached that age,
but will feel it a practical comfort to him to know that the
young ladies of his family are at all events good cooks; and
understand, as the French do, thrift in the matter of food.</p>
<p>Neither will any parent who wishes, naturally enough, that his
daughters should cost him as little as possible; and wishes,
naturally enough also, that they should be as well dressed as
possible, deny that it would be a good thing for them to be
practical milliners and mantua-makers; and, by making their own
clothes gracefully and well, exercise thrift in clothing.</p>
<p>But, beside this thrift in clothing, I am not alone, I
believe, in wishing for some thrift in the energy which produces
it.&nbsp; Labour misapplied, you will agree, is labour wasted;
and as dress, I presume, is intended to adorn the person of the
wearer, the making a dress which only disfigures her may be
considered as a plain case of waste.&nbsp; It would be
impertinent in me to go into any details: but it is impossible to
walk about the streets now without passing young people who must
be under a deep delusion as to the success of their own
toilette.&nbsp; Instead of graceful and noble simplicity of form,
instead of combinations of colour at once rich and delicate,
because in accordance with the chromatic laws of nature, one
meets with phenomena more and more painful to the eye, and
startling to common sense, till one would be hardly more
astonished, and certainly hardly more shocked, if in a year or
two, one should pass someone going about like a Chinese lady,
with pinched feet, or like a savage of the Amazons, with a wooden
bung through her lower lip.&nbsp; It is easy to complain of these
monstrosities: but impossible to cure them, it seems to me,
without an education of the taste, an education in those laws of
nature which produce beauty in form and beauty in colour.&nbsp;
For that the cause of these failures lies in want of education is
patent.&nbsp; They are most common in&mdash;I had almost said
they are confined to&mdash;those classes of well-to-do persons
who are the least educated; who have no standard of taste of
their own; and who do not acquire any from cultivated friends and
relations: who, in consequence, dress themselves blindly
according to what they conceive to be the Paris fashions,
conveyed at third-hand through an equally uneducated dressmaker;
in innocent ignorance of the fact&mdash;for fact I believe it to
be&mdash;that Paris fashions are invented now not in the least
for the sake of beauty, but for the sake of producing, through
variety, increased expenditure, and thereby increased employment;
according to the strange system which now prevails in France of
compelling, if not prosperity, at least the signs of it; and like
schoolboys before a holiday, nailing up the head of the
weather-glass to insure fine weather.</p>
<p>Let British ladies educate themselves in those laws of beauty
which are as eternal as any other of nature&rsquo;s laws; which
may be seen fulfilled, as Mr. Ruskin tells us, so eloquently in
every flower and every leaf, in every sweeping down and rippling
wave; and they will be able to invent graceful and economical
dresses for themselves, without importing tawdry and expensive
ugliness from France.</p>
<p>Let me now go a step farther, and ask you to consider this:
There are in England now a vast number, and an increasing number,
of young women who, from various circumstances which we all know,
must in after life be either the mistresses of their own
fortunes, or the earners of their own bread.&nbsp; And, to do
that wisely and well, they must be more or less women of
business, and to be women of business they must know something of
the meaning of the words Capital, Profit, Price, Value, Labour,
Wages, and of the relation between those two last.&nbsp; In a
word, they must know a little political economy.&nbsp; Nay, I
sometimes think that the mistress of every household might find,
not only thrift of money, but thrift of brain; freedom from
mistakes, anxieties, worries of many kinds, all of which eat out
the health as well as the heart, by a little sound knowledge of
the principles of political economy.</p>
<p>When we consider that every mistress of a household is
continually buying, if not selling; that she is continually
hiring and employing labour in the form of servants; and very
often, into the bargain, keeping her husband&rsquo;s accounts: I
cannot but think that her hard-worked brain might be clearer, and
her hard-tried desire to do her duty by every subject in her
little kingdom, might be more easily satisfied, had she read
something of what Mr. John Stuart Mill has written, especially on
the duties of employer and employed.&nbsp; A capitalist, a
commercialist, an employer of labour, and an
accountant&mdash;every mistress of a household is all these,
whether she likes it or not; and it would be surely well for her,
in so very complicated a state of society as this, not to trust
merely to that mother-wit, that intuitive sagacity and innate
power of ruling her fellow-creatures, which carries women so
nobly through their work in simpler and less civilised
societies.</p>
<p>And here I stop to answer those who may say&mdash;as I have
heard it said&mdash;That a woman&rsquo;s intellect is not fit for
business; that when a woman takes to business, she is apt to do
it ill, and unpleasantly likewise, to be more suspicious, more
irritable, more grasping, more unreasonable, than regular men of
business would be: that&mdash;as I have heard it
put&mdash;&ldquo;a woman does not fight fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
answer is simple.&nbsp; That a woman&rsquo;s intellect is
eminently fitted for business is proved by the enormous amount of
business she gets through without any special training for it:
but those faults in a woman of which some men complain are simply
the results of her not having had a special training.&nbsp; She
does not know the laws of business.&nbsp; She does not know the
rules of the game she is playing; and therefore she is playing it
in the dark, in fear and suspicion, apt to judge of questions on
personal grounds, often offending those with whom she has to do,
and oftener still making herself miserable over matters of law or
of business, on which a little sound knowledge would set her head
and her heart at rest.</p>
<p>When I have seen widows, having the care of children, of a
great household, of a great estate, of a great business,
struggling heroically, and yet often mistakenly; blamed severely
for selfishness and ambition, while they were really sacrificing
themselves with the divine instinct of a mother for their
children&rsquo;s interest: I have stood by with mingled
admiration and pity, and said to myself: &ldquo;How nobly she is
doing the work without teaching!&nbsp; How much more nobly would
she have done it had she been taught!&nbsp; She is now doing her
work at the most enormous waste of energy and of virtue: had she
had knowledge, thrift would have followed it; she would have done
more work with far less trouble.&nbsp; She will probably kill
herself if she goes on; while sound knowledge would have saved
her health, saved her heart, saved her friends, and helped the
very loved ones for whom she labours, not always with
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little political economy, therefore, will at least do no
harm to a woman; especially if she have to take care of herself
in after life; neither, I think, will she be much harmed by some
sound knowledge of another subject, which I see promised in these
lectures: &ldquo;Natural philosophy, in its various branches,
such as the chemistry of common life, light, heat, electricity,
etc. etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little knowledge of the laws of light, for instance, would
teach many women that by shutting themselves up day after day,
week after week, in darkened rooms, they are as certainly
committing a waste of health, destroying their vital energy, and
diseasing their brains, as if they were taking so much poison the
whole time.</p>
<p>A little knowledge of the laws of heat would teach women not
to clothe themselves and their children after foolish and
insufficient fashions, which in this climate sow the seeds of a
dozen different diseases, and have to be atoned for by perpetual
anxieties, and by perpetual doctors&rsquo; bills; and as for a
little knowledge of the laws of electricity, one thrift I am sure
it would produce&mdash;thrift to us men, of having to answer
continual inquiries as to what the weather is going to be, when a
slight knowledge of the barometer, or of the form of the clouds
and the direction of the wind, would enable many a lady to judge
for herself, and not, after inquiry on inquiry, regardless of all
warnings, go out on the first appearance of a strip of blue sky,
and come home wet through, with what she calls &ldquo;only a
chill,&rdquo; but which really means a nail driven into her
coffin&mdash;a probable shortening, though it may be a very small
one, of her mortal life; because the food of the next twenty-four
hours, which should have gone to keep the vital heat at its
normal standard, will have to be wasted in raising it up to that
standard, from which it has fallen by a chill.</p>
<p>Ladies, these are subjects on which I must beg to speak a
little more at length, premising them by one statement, which may
seem jest, but is solemn earnest&mdash;that, if the medical men
of this or any other city were what the world now calls
&ldquo;alive to their own interests&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to the
mere making of money; instead of being, what medical men are, the
most generous, disinterested, and high-minded class in these
realms, then they would oppose by all means in their power the
delivery of lectures on natural philosophy to women.&nbsp; For if
women act upon what they learn in those lectures&mdash;and having
women&rsquo;s hearts, they will act upon it&mdash;there ought to
follow a decrease of sickness and an increase of health,
especially among children; a thrift of life, and a thrift of
expense besides, which would very seriously affect the income of
medical men.</p>
<p>For let me ask you, ladies, with all courtesy, but with all
earnestness&mdash;Are you aware of certain facts, of which every
one of those excellent medical men is too well aware?&nbsp; Are
you aware that more human beings are killed in England every year
by unnecessary and preventable diseases than were killed at
Waterloo or at Sadowa?&nbsp; Are you aware that the great
majority of those victims are children?&nbsp; Are you aware that
the diseases which carry them off are for the most part such as
ought to be specially under the control of the women who love
them, pet them, educate them, and would in many cases, if need
be, lay down their lives for them?&nbsp; Are you aware, again, of
the vast amount of disease which, so both wise mothers and wise
doctors assure me, is engendered in the sleeping-room from simple
ignorance of the laws of ventilation, and in the schoolroom
likewise, from simple ignorance of the laws of physiology? from
an ignorance of which I shall mention no other case here save
one&mdash;that too often from ignorance of signs of approaching
disease, a child is punished for what is called idleness,
listlessness, wilfulness, sulkiness; and punished, too, in the
unwisest way&mdash;by an increase of tasks and confinement to the
house, thus overtasking still more a brain already overtasked,
and depressing still more, by robbing it of oxygen and of
exercise, a system already depressed?&nbsp; Are you aware, I ask
again, of all this?&nbsp; I speak earnest upon this point,
because I speak with experience.&nbsp; As a single instance: a
medical man, a friend of mine, passing by his own schoolroom,
heard one of his own little girls screaming and crying, and went
in.&nbsp; The governess, an excellent woman, but wholly ignorant
of the laws of physiology, complained that the child had of late
become obstinate and would not learn; and that therefore she must
punish her by keeping her indoors over the unlearnt
lessons.&nbsp; The father, who knew that the child was usually a
very good one, looked at her carefully for a little while; sent
her out of the schoolroom; and then said, &ldquo;That child must
not open a book for a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had not
acted so,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;I should have had that
child dead of brain-disease within the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, in the face of such facts as these, is it too much to ask
of mothers, sisters, aunts, nurses, governesses&mdash;all who may
be occupied in the care of children, especially of
girls&mdash;that they should study thrift of human health and
human life, by studying somewhat the laws of life and
health?&nbsp; There are books&mdash;I may say a whole literature
of books&mdash;written by scientific doctors on these matters,
which are in my mind far more important to the schoolroom than
half the trashy accomplishments, so-called, which are expected to
be known by governesses.&nbsp; But are they bought?&nbsp; Are
they even to be bought, from most country booksellers?&nbsp; Ah,
for a little knowledge of the laws to the neglect of which is
owing so much fearful disease, which, if it does not produce
immediate death, too often leaves the constitution impaired for
years to come.&nbsp; Ah the waste of health and strength in the
young; the waste, too, of anxiety and misery in those who love
and tend them.&nbsp; How much of it might be saved by a little
rational education in those laws of nature which are the will of
God about the welfare of our bodies, and which, therefore, we are
as much bound to know and to obey, as we are bound to know and
obey the spiritual laws whereon depends the welfare of our
souls.</p>
<p>Pardon me, ladies, if I have given a moment&rsquo;s pain to
anyone here: but I appeal to every medical man in the room
whether I have not spoken the truth; and having such an
opportunity as this, I felt that I must speak for the sake of
children, and of women likewise, or else for ever hereafter hold
my peace.</p>
<p>Let me pass on from this painful subject&mdash;for painful it
has been to me for many years&mdash;to a question of intellectual
thrift&mdash;by which I mean just now thrift of words; thrift of
truth; restraint of the tongue; accuracy and modesty in
statement.</p>
<p>Mothers complain to me that girls are apt to be&mdash;not
intentionally untruthful&mdash;but exaggerative, prejudiced,
incorrect, in repeating a conversation or describing an event;
and that from this fault arise, as is to be expected,
misunderstandings, quarrels, rumours, slanders, scandals, and
what not.</p>
<p>Now, for this waste of words there is but one cure: and if I
be told that it is a natural fault of women; that they cannot
take the calm judicial view of matters which men boast, and often
boast most wrongly, that they can take; that under the influence
of hope, fear, delicate antipathy, honest moral indignation, they
will let their eyes and ears be governed by their feelings; and
see and hear only what they wish to see and hear&mdash;I answer,
that it is not for me as a man to start such a theory; but that
if it be true, it is an additional argument for some education
which will correct this supposed natural defect.&nbsp; And I say
deliberately that there is but one sort of education which will
correct it; one which will teach young women to observe facts
accurately, judge them calmly, and describe them carefully,
without adding or distorting: and that is, some training in
natural science.</p>
<p>I beg you not to be startled: but if you are, then test the
truth of my theory by playing to-night at the game called
&ldquo;Russian Scandal;&rdquo; in which a story, repeated in
secret by one player to the other, comes out at the end of the
game, owing to the inaccurate and&mdash;forgive me if I say
it&mdash;uneducated brains through which it has passed, utterly
unlike its original; not only ludicrously maimed and distorted,
but often with the most fantastic additions of events, details,
names, dates, places, which each player will aver that he
received from the player before him.&nbsp; I am afraid that too
much of the average gossip of every city, town, and village is
little more than a game of &ldquo;Russian Scandal;&rdquo; with
this difference that while one is but a game, the other is but
too mischievous earnest.</p>
<p>But now, if among your party there shall be an average lawyer,
medical man, or man of science, you will find that he, and
perhaps he alone, will be able to retail accurately the story
which has been told him.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Simply because his
mind has been trained to deal with facts; to ascertain exactly
what he does see or hear, and to imprint its leading features
strongly and clearly on his memory.</p>
<p>Now, you certainly cannot make young ladies barristers or
attorneys; nor employ their brains in getting up cases, civil or
criminal; and as for chemistry, they and their parents may have a
reasonable antipathy to smells, blackened fingers, and occasional
explosions and poisonings.&nbsp; But you may make them something
of botanists, zoologists, geologists.</p>
<p>I could say much on this point: allow me at least to say this:
I verify believe that any young lady who would employ some of her
leisure time in collecting wild flowers, carefully examining
them, verifying them, and arranging them; or who would in her
summer trip to the sea-coast do the same by the common objects of
the shore, instead of wasting her holiday, as one sees hundreds
doing, in lounging on benches on the esplanade, reading worthless
novels, and criticising dresses&mdash;that such a young lady, I
say, would not only open her own mind to a world of wonder,
beauty, and wisdom, which, if it did not make her a more reverent
and pious soul, she cannot be the woman which I take for granted
she is; but would save herself from the habit&mdash;I had almost
said the necessity&mdash;of gossip; because she would have things
to think of and not merely persons; facts instead of fancies;
while she would acquire something of accuracy, of patience, of
methodical observation and judgment, which would stand her in
good stead in the events of daily life, and increase her power of
bridling her tongue and her imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is in
heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be
few;&rdquo; is the lesson which those are learning all day long
who study the works of God with reverent accuracy, lest by
misrepresenting them they should be tempted to say that God has
done that which He has not; and in that wholesome discipline I
long that women as well as men should share.</p>
<p>And now I come to a thrift of the highest kind, as contrasted
with a waste the most deplorable and ruinous of all; thrift of
those faculties which connect us with the unseen and spiritual
world; with humanity, with Christ, with God; thrift of the
immortal spirit.&nbsp; I am not going now to give you a sermon on
duty.&nbsp; You hear such, I doubt not, in church every Sunday,
far better than I can preach to you.&nbsp; I am going to speak
rather of thrift of the heart, thrift of the emotions.&nbsp; How
they are wasted in these days in reading what are called
sensation novels, all know but too well; how British
literature&mdash;all that the best hearts and intellects among
our forefathers have bequeathed to us&mdash;is neglected for
light fiction, the reading of which is, as a lady well said,
&ldquo;the worst form of intemperance&mdash;dram-drinking and
opium-eating, intellectual and moral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that the young will delight&mdash;they have delighted
in all ages, and will to the end of time&mdash;in fictions which
deal with that &ldquo;oldest tale which is for ever
new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Novels will be read: but that is all the more
reason why women should be trained, by the perusal of a higher,
broader, deeper literature, to distinguish the good novel from
the bad, the moral from the immoral, the noble from the base, the
true work of art from the sham which hides its shallowness and
vulgarity under a tangled plot and melodramatic situations.&nbsp;
She should learn&mdash;and that she can only learn by
cultivation&mdash;to discern with joy, and drink in with
reverence, the good, the beautiful, and the true; and to turn
with the fine scorn of a pure and strong womanhood from the bad,
the ugly, and the false.</p>
<p>And if any parent should be inclined to reply: &ldquo;Why lay
so much stress upon educating a girl in British literature?&nbsp;
Is it not far more important to make our daughters read religious
books?&rdquo;&nbsp; I answer&mdash;Of course it is.&nbsp; I take
for granted that that is done in a Christian land.&nbsp; But I
beg you to recollect that there are books and books; and that in
these days of a free press it is impossible, in the long run, to
prevent girls reading books of very different shades of opinion,
and very different religious worth.&nbsp; It may be, therefore,
of the very highest importance to a girl to have her intellect,
her taste, her emotions, her moral sense, in a word, her whole
womanhood, so cultivated and regulated that she shall herself be
able to discern the true from the false, the orthodox from the
unorthodox, the truly devout from the merely sentimental, the
Gospel from its counterfeits.</p>
<p>I should have thought that there never had been in Britain,
since the Reformation, a crisis at which young Englishwomen
required more careful cultivation on these matters; if at least
they are to be saved from making themselves and their families
miserable; and from ending&mdash;as I have known too many
end&mdash;with broken hearts, broken brains, broken health, and
an early grave.</p>
<p>Take warning by what you see abroad.&nbsp; In every country
where the women are uneducated, unoccupied; where their only
literature is French novels or translations of them&mdash;in
every one of those countries the women, even to the highest, are
the slaves of superstition, and the puppets of priests.&nbsp; In
proportion as, in certain other countries&mdash;notably, I will
say, in Scotland&mdash;the women are highly educated, family life
and family secrets are sacred, and the woman owns allegiance and
devotion to no confessor or director, but to her own husband or
to her own family.</p>
<p>I say plainly, that if any parents wish their daughters to
succumb at least to some quackery or superstition, whether
calling itself scientific, or calling itself religious&mdash;and
there are too many of both just now&mdash;they cannot more
certainly effect their purpose than by allowing her to grow up
ignorant, frivolous, luxurious, vain; with her emotions excited,
but not satisfied, by the reading of foolish and even immoral
novels.</p>
<p>In such a case the more delicate and graceful the
organisation, the more noble and earnest the nature, which has
been neglected, the more certain it is&mdash;I know too well what
I am saying&mdash;to go astray.</p>
<p>The time of depression, disappointment, vacuity, all but
despair must come.&nbsp; The immortal spirit, finding no healthy
satisfaction for its highest aspirations, is but too likely to
betake itself to an unhealthy and exciting superstition.&nbsp;
Ashamed of its own long self-indulgence, it is but too likely to
flee from itself into a morbid asceticism.&nbsp; Not having been
taught its God-given and natural duties in the world, it is but
too likely to betake itself, from the mere craving for action, to
self-invented and unnatural duties out of the world.&nbsp;
Ignorant of true science, yet craving to understand the wonders
of nature and of spirit, it is but too likely to betake itself to
non-science&mdash;nonsense as it is usually called&mdash;whether
of spirit-rapping and mesmerism, or of miraculous relics and
winking pictures.&nbsp; Longing for guidance and teaching, and
never having been taught to guide and teach itself, it is but too
likely to deliver itself up in self-despair to the guidance and
teaching of those who, whether they be quacks or fanatics, look
on uneducated women as their natural prey.</p>
<p>You will see, I am sure, from what I have said, that it is not
my wish that you should become mere learned women; mere female
pedants, as useless and unpleasing as male pedants are wont to
be.&nbsp; The education which I set before you is not to be got
by mere hearing lectures or reading books: for it is an education
of your whole character; a self-education; which really means a
committing of yourself to God, that He may educate you.&nbsp;
Hearing lectures is good, for it will teach you how much there is
to be known, and how little you know.&nbsp; Reading books is
good, for it will give you habits of regular and diligent
study.&nbsp; And therefore I urge on you strongly private study,
especially in case a library should be formed here of books on
those most practical subjects of which I have been
speaking.&nbsp; But, after all, both lectures and books are good,
mainly in as far as they furnish matter for reflection: while the
desire to reflect and the ability to reflect must come, as I
believe, from above.&nbsp; The honest craving after light and
power, after knowledge, wisdom, active usefulness, must
come&mdash;and may it come to you&mdash;by the inspiration of the
Spirit of God.</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; Let me ask women to
educate themselves, not for their own sakes merely, but for the
sake of others.&nbsp; For, whether they will or not, they must
educate others.&nbsp; I do not speak merely of those who may be
engaged in the work of direct teaching; that they ought to be
well taught themselves, who can doubt?&nbsp; I speak of
those&mdash;and in so doing I speak of every woman, young and
old&mdash;who exercise as wife, as mother, as aunt, as sister, or
as friend, an influence, indirect it may be, and unconscious, but
still potent and practical, on the minds and characters of those
about them, especially of men.&nbsp; How potent and practical
that influence is, those know best who know most of the world and
most of human nature.&nbsp; There are those who
consider&mdash;and I agree with them&mdash;that the education of
boys under the age of twelve years ought to be entrusted as much
as possible to women.&nbsp; Let me ask&mdash;of what period of
youth and manhood does not the same hold true?&nbsp; I pity the
ignorance and conceit of the man who fancies that he has nothing
left to learn from cultivated women.&nbsp; I should have thought
that the very mission of woman was to be, in the highest sense,
the educator of man from infancy to old age; that that was the
work towards which all the God-given capacities of women pointed;
for which they were to be educated to the highest pitch.&nbsp; I
should have thought that it was the glory of woman that she was
sent into the world to live for others, rather than for herself;
and therefore I should say&mdash;Let her smallest rights be
respected, her smallest wrongs redressed: but let her never be
persuaded to forget that she is sent into the world to teach
man&mdash;what, I believe, she has been teaching him all along,
even in the savage state&mdash;namely, that there is something
more necessary than the claiming of rights, and that is, the
performing of duties; to teach him specially, in these so-called
intellectual days, that there is something more than intellect,
and that is&mdash;purity and virtue.&nbsp; Let her never be
persuaded to forget that her calling is not the lower and more
earthly one of self-assertion, but the higher and the diviner
calling of self-sacrifice; and let her never desert that higher
life, which lives in others and for others, like her Redeemer and
her Lord.</p>
<p>And if any should answer that this doctrine would keep woman a
dependent and a slave, I rejoin&mdash;Not so: it would keep her
what she should be&mdash;the mistress of all around her, because
mistress of herself.&nbsp; And more, I should express a fear that
those who made that answer had not yet seen into the mystery of
true greatness and true strength; that they did not yet
understand the true magnanimity, the true royalty of that spirit,
by which the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.</p>
<p>Surely that is woman&rsquo;s calling&mdash;to teach man: and
to teach him what?&nbsp; To teach him, after all, that his
calling is the same as hers, if he will but see the things which
belong to his peace.&nbsp; To temper his fiercer, coarser, more
self-assertive nature, by the contact of her gentleness, purity,
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; To make him see that not by blare of
trumpets, not by noise, wrath, greed, ambition, intrigue,
puffery, is good and lasting work to be done on earth: but by
wise self-distrust, by silent labour, by lofty self-control, by
that charity which hopeth all things, believeth all things,
endureth all things; by such an example, in short, as women now
in tens of thousands set to those around them; such as they will
show more and more, the more their whole womanhood is educated to
employ its powers without waste and without haste in harmonious
unity.&nbsp; Let the woman begin in girlhood, if such be her
happy lot&mdash;to quote the words of a great poet, a great
philosopher, and a great Churchman, William Wordsworth&mdash;let
her begin, I say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With all things round about her drawn<br />
From May-time and the cheerful dawn;<br />
A dancing shape, an image gay,<br />
To haunt, to startle, and waylay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let her develop onwards&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A spirit, yet a woman too,<br />
With household motions light and free,<br />
And steps of virgin liberty.<br />
A countenance in which shall meet<br />
Sweet records, promises as sweet;<br />
A creature not too bright and good<br />
For human nature&rsquo;s daily food;<br />
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br />
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let her highest and her final development be that which
not nature, but self-education alone can bring&mdash;that which
makes her once and for ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A being breathing thoughtful breath;<br />
A traveller betwixt life and death.<br />
With reason firm, with temperate will<br />
Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill.<br />
A perfect woman, nobly planned,<br />
To warn, to comfort, and command.<br />
And yet a spirit still and bright<br />
With something of an angel light.</p>

107</span>NAUSICAA IN LONDON;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
THE LOWER EDUCATION OF WOMEN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fresh</span> from the Marbles of the
British Museum, I went my way through London streets.&nbsp; My
brain was still full of fair and grand forms; the forms of men
and women whose every limb and attitude betokened perfect health,
and grace, and power, and self-possession and self-restraint so
habitual and complete that it had become unconscious, and
undistinguishable from the native freedom of the savage.&nbsp;
For I had been up and down the corridors of those Greek
sculptures, which remain as a perpetual sermon to rich and poor,
amid our artificial, unwholesome, and it may be decaying
pseudo-civilisation, saying with looks more expressive than all
words&mdash;Such men and women can be; for such they have been;
and such you may be yet, if you will use that science of which
you too often only boast.&nbsp; Above all, I had been pondering
over the awful and yet tender beauty of the maiden figures from
the Parthenon and its kindred temples.&nbsp; And these, or such
as these, I thought to myself, were the sisters of the men who
fought at Marathon and Salamis; the mothers of many a man among
the ten thousand whom Xenophon led back from Babylon to the Black
Sea shore; the ancestresses of many a man who conquered the East
in Alexander&rsquo;s host, and fought with Porus in the far
Punjab.&nbsp; And were these women mere dolls?&nbsp; These men
mere gladiators?&nbsp; Were they not the parents of philosophy,
science, poetry, the plastic arts?&nbsp; We talk of education
now.&nbsp; Are we more educated than were the ancient
Greeks?&nbsp; Do we know anything about education, physical,
intellectual, or &aelig;sthetic, and I may say moral
likewise&mdash;religious education, of course, in our sense of
the world, they had none&mdash;but do we know anything about
education of which they have not taught us at least the
rudiments?&nbsp; Are there not some branches of education which
they perfected, once and for ever; leaving us northern barbarians
to follow, or else not to follow, their example?&nbsp; To produce
health, that is, harmony and sympathy, proportion and grace, in
every faculty of mind and body&mdash;that was their notion of
education.&nbsp; To produce that, the text-book of their
childhood was the poetry of Homer, and not of&mdash;But I am
treading on dangerous ground.&nbsp; It was for this that the
seafaring Greek lad was taught to find his ideal in Ulysses;
while his sister at home found hers, it may be, in
Nausicaa.&nbsp; It was for this, that when perhaps the most
complete and exquisite of all the Greeks, Sophocles the good,
beloved by gods and men, represented on the Athenian stage his
drama of Nausicaa, and, as usual, could not&mdash;for he had no
voice&mdash;himself take a speaking part, he was content to do
one thing in which he specially excelled; and dressed and masked
as a girl, to play at ball amid the chorus of Nausicaa&rsquo;s
maidens.</p>
<p>That drama of Nausicaa is lost; and if I dare say so of any
play of Sophocles&rsquo;, I scarce regret it.&nbsp; It is well,
perhaps, that we have no second conception of the scene, to
interfere with the simplicity, so grand, and yet so tender, of
Homer&rsquo;s idyllic episode.</p>
<p>Nausicaa, it must be remembered, is the daughter of a
king.&nbsp; But not of a king in the exclusive modern European or
old Eastern sense.&nbsp; Her father, Alcinous, is simply primus
inter pares among a community of merchants, who are called
&ldquo;kings&rdquo; likewise; and Mayor for life&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;of a new trading city, a nascent Genoa or Venice, on
the shore of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; But the girl Nausicaa, as
she sleeps in her &ldquo;carved chamber,&rdquo; is &ldquo;like
the immortals in form and face;&rdquo; and two handmaidens who
sleep on each side of the polished door &ldquo;have beauty from
the Graces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her there enters, in the shape of some maiden friend, none
less than Pallas Athen&eacute; herself, intent on saving worthily
her favourite, the shipwrecked Ulysses; and bids her in a dream
go forth&mdash;and wash the clothes. <a name="citation110"></a><a
href="#footnote110" class="citation">[110]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nausicaa, wherefore doth thy
mother bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Child so forgetful?&nbsp; This long time doth
rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like lumber in the house, much raiment fair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon must thou wed, and be thyself well-drest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And find thy bridegroom raiment of the best.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the things whence good repute is born,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And praises that make glad a parent&rsquo;s
breast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let us both go washing with the morn;<br />
So shalt thou have clothes becoming to be worn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that thy maidenhood is not for long,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom the Phoeacian chiefs already woo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the land whence thou thyself art sprung.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon as the shining dawn comes forth anew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For wain and mules thy noble father sue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to the place of washing shall convey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Girdles and shawls and rugs of splendid hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This for thyself were better than essay<br />
Thither to walk: the place is distant a long way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Startled by her dream, Nausicaa awakes, and goes to find her
parents&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by the hearth sat, with the
maids around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the skeins of yarn, sea-purpled, spent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her morning toil.&nbsp; Him to the council bound,<br
/>
Called by the honoured kings, just going forth she found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And calling him, as she might now, Pappa phile, Dear Papa,
asks for the mule-waggon: but it is her father&rsquo;s and her
five brothers&rsquo; clothes she fain would wash,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ashamed to name her marriage to her father
dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he understood all&mdash;and she goes forth in the
mule-waggon, with the clothes, after her mother has put in
&ldquo;a chest of all kinds of delicate food, and meat, and wine
in a goatskin;&rdquo; and last but not least, the indispensable
cruse of oil for anointing after the bath, to which both Jews,
Greeks, and Romans owed so much health and beauty.&nbsp; And then
we read in the simple verse of a poet too refined, like the rest
of his race, to see anything mean or ridiculous in that which was
not ugly and unnatural, how she and her maids got into the
&ldquo;polished waggon,&rdquo; &ldquo;with good wheels,&rdquo;
and she &ldquo;took the whip and the studded reins,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;beat them till they started;&rdquo; and how the mules,
&ldquo;rattled&rdquo; away, and &ldquo;pulled against each
other,&rdquo; till</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came to the fair
flowing river<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which feeds good lavatories all the year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitted to cleanse all sullied robes soever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They from the wain the mules unharnessed there,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chased them free, to crop their juicy fare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the swift river, on the margin green;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then to the waters dashed the clothes they bare<br
/>
And in the stream-filled trenches stamped them clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, having washed and cleansed, they
spread before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sunbeams, on the beach, where most did lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick pebbles, by the sea-wave washed ashore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, having left them in the heat to dry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They to the bath went down, and by-and-by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rubbed with rich oil, their midday meal essay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Couched in green turf, the river rolling nigh.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, throwing off their veils, at ball they
play,<br />
While the white-armed Nausicaa leads the choral lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mere beauty of this scene all will feel, who have the
sense of beauty in them.&nbsp; Yet it is not on that aspect which
I wish to dwell, but on its healthfulness.&nbsp; Exercise is
taken, in measured time, to the sound of song, as a duty almost,
as well as an amusement.&nbsp; For this game of ball, which is
here mentioned for the first time in human literature, nearly
three thousand years ago, was held by the Greeks and by the
Romans after them, to be an almost necessary part of a liberal
education; principally, doubtless, from the development which it
produced in the upper half of the body, not merely to the arms,
but to the chest, by raising and expanding the ribs, and to all
the muscles of the torso, whether perpendicular or oblique.&nbsp;
The elasticity and grace which it was believed to give were so
much prized, that a room for ball-play, and a teacher of the art,
were integral parts of every gymnasium; and the Athenians went so
far as to bestow on one famous ball-player, Aristonicus of
Carystia, a statue and the rights of citizenship.&nbsp; The rough
and hardy young Spartans, when passing from boyhood into manhood,
received the title of ball-players, seemingly from the game which
it was then their special duty to learn.&nbsp; In the case of
Nausicaa and her maidens, the game would just bring into their
right places all that is liable to be contracted and weakened in
women, so many of whose occupations must needs be sedentary and
stooping; while the song which accompanied the game at once
filled the lungs regularly and rhythmically, and prevented
violent motion, or unseemly attitude.&nbsp; We, the civilised,
need physiologists to remind us of these simple facts, and even
then do not act on them.&nbsp; Those old half-barbarous Greeks
had found them out for themselves, and, moreover, acted on
them.</p>
<p>But fair Nausicaa must have been&mdash;some will
say&mdash;surely a mere child of nature, and an uncultivated
person?</p>
<p>So far from it, that her whole demeanour and speech show
culture of the very highest sort, full of &ldquo;sweetness and
light.&rdquo;&mdash;Intelligent and fearless, quick to perceive
the bearings of her strange and sudden adventure, quick to
perceive the character of Ulysses, quick to answer his lofty and
refined pleading by words as lofty and refined, and pious
withal;&mdash;for it is she who speaks to her handmaids the once
so famous words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Strangers and poor men all are sent from Zeus;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And alms, though small, are
sweet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clear of intellect, prompt of action, modest of demeanour,
shrinking from the slightest breath of scandal; while she is not
ashamed, when Ulysses, bathed and dressed, looks himself again,
to whisper to her maidens her wish that the Gods might send her
such a spouse.&mdash;This is Nausicaa as Homer draws her; and as
many a scholar and poet since Homer has accepted her for the
ideal of noble maidenhood.&nbsp; I ask my readers to study for
themselves her interview with Ulysses, in Mr. Worsley&rsquo;s
translation, or rather in the grand simplicity of the original
Greek, <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> and judge whether Nausicaa is not as
perfect a lady as the poet who imagined her&mdash;or, it may be,
drew her from life&mdash;must have been a perfect gentleman; both
complete in those &ldquo;manners&rdquo; which, says the old
proverb, &ldquo;make the man:&rdquo; but which are the woman
herself; because with her&mdash;who acts more by emotion than by
calculation&mdash;manners are the outward and visible tokens of
her inward and spiritual grace, or disgrace; and flow
instinctively, whether good or bad, from the instincts of her
inner nature.</p>
<p>True, Nausicaa could neither read nor write.&nbsp; No more,
most probably, could the author of the Odyssey.&nbsp; No more,
for that matter, could Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, though they
were plainly, both in mind and manners, most highly-cultivated
men.&nbsp; Reading and writing, of course, have now become
necessaries of humanity; and are to be given to every human
being, that he may start fair in the race of life.&nbsp; But I am
not aware that Greek women improved much, either in manners,
morals, or happiness, by acquiring them in after centuries.&nbsp;
A wise man would sooner see his daughter a Nausicaa than a
Sappho, an Aspasia, a Cleopatra, or even an Hypatia.</p>
<p>Full of such thoughts, I went through London streets, among
the Nausicaas of the present day; the girls of the period; the
daughters and hereafter mothers of our future rulers, the great
Demos or commercial middle class of the greatest mercantile city
in the world: and noted what I had noted with fear and sorrow,
many a day, for many a year; a type, and an increasing type, of
young women who certainly had not had the
&ldquo;advantages,&rdquo; &ldquo;educational&rdquo; and other, of
that Greek Nausicaa of old.</p>
<p>Of course, in such a city as London, to which the best of
everything, physical and other, gravitates, I could not but pass,
now and then, beautiful persons, who made me proud of those
grandes Anglaises aux joues rouges, whom the Parisiennes
ridicule&mdash;and envy.&nbsp; But I could not help suspecting
that their looks showed them to be either country-bred, or born
of country parents; and this suspicion was strengthened by the
fact that, when compared with their mothers, the mother&rsquo;s
physique was, in the majority of cases, superior to the
daughters&rsquo;.&nbsp; Painful it was, to one accustomed to the
ruddy well-grown peasant girl, stalwart, even when, as often,
squat and plain, to remark the exceedingly small size of the
average young woman; by which I do not mean mere want of
height&mdash;that is a little matter&mdash;but want of breadth
likewise; a general want of those large frames, which indicate
usually a power of keeping strong and healthy not merely the
muscles, but the brain itself.</p>
<p>Poor little things.&nbsp; I passed hundreds&mdash;I pass
hundreds every day&mdash;trying to hide their littleness by the
nasty mass of false hair&mdash;or what does duty for it; and by
the ugly and useless hat which is stuck upon it, making the head
thereby look ridiculously large and heavy; and by the high heels
on which they totter onward, having forgotten, or never learnt,
the simple art of walking; their bodies tilted forward in that
ungraceful attitude which is called&mdash;why that name of all
others?&mdash;a &ldquo;Grecian bend;&rdquo; seemingly kept on
their feet, and kept together at all, in that strange attitude,
by tight stays which prevented all graceful and healthy motion of
the hips or sides; their raiment, meanwhile, being purposely
misshapen in this direction and in that, to hide&mdash;it must be
presumed&mdash;deficiencies of form.&nbsp; If that chignon and
those heels had been taken off, the figure which would have
remained would have been that too often of a puny girl of
sixteen.&nbsp; And yet there was no doubt that these women were
not only full grown, but some of them, alas! wives and
mothers.</p>
<p>Poor little things.&mdash;And this they have gained by
so-called civilisation: the power of aping the
&ldquo;fashions&rdquo; by which the worn-out
&ldquo;Parisienne&rdquo; hides her own personal defects; and of
making themselves, by innate want of that taste which the
&ldquo;Parisienne&rdquo; possesses, only the cause of something
like a sneer from many a cultivated man; and of something like a
sneer, too, from yonder gipsy woman who passes by, with bold
bright face, and swinging hip, and footstep stately and elastic;
far better dressed, according to all true canons of taste, than
most town-girls; and thanking her fate that she and her
&ldquo;Rom&rdquo; are no house-dwellers and gaslight-sightseers,
but fatten on free air upon the open moor.</p>
<p>But the face which is beneath that chignon and that hat?&nbsp;
Well&mdash;it is sometimes pretty: but how seldom handsome, which
is a higher quality by far.&nbsp; It is not, strange to say, a
well-fed face.&nbsp; Plenty of money, and perhaps too much, is
spent on those fine clothes.&nbsp; It had been better, to judge
from the complexion, if some of that money had been spent in
solid wholesome food.&nbsp; She looks as if she lived&mdash;as
she too often does, I hear&mdash;on tea and bread-and-butter, or
rather on bread with the minimum of butter.&nbsp; For as the want
of bone indicates a deficiency of phosphatic food, so does the
want of flesh about the cheeks indicate a deficiency of
hydrocarbon.&nbsp; Poor little Nausicaa:&mdash;that is not her
fault.&nbsp; Our boasted civilisation has not even taught her
what to eat, as it certainly has not increased her appetite; and
she knows not&mdash;what every country fellow knows&mdash;that
without plenty of butter and other fatty matters, she is not
likely to keep even warm.&nbsp; Better to eat nasty fat bacon
now, than to supply the want of it some few years hence by
nastier cod-liver oil.&nbsp; But there is no one yet to tell her
that, and a dozen other equally simple facts, for her own sake,
and for the sake of that coming Demos which she is to bring into
the world; a Demos which, if we can only keep it healthy in body
and brain, has before it so splendid a future: but which, if body
and brain degrade beneath the influence of modern barbarism, is
but too likely to follow the Demos of ancient Byzantium, or of
modern Paris.</p>
<p>Ay, but her intellect.&nbsp; She is so clever, and she reads
so much, and she is going to be taught to read so much more.</p>
<p>Ah well&mdash;there was once a science called
Physiognomy.&nbsp; The Greeks, from what I can learn, knew more
of it than any people since: though the Italian painters and
sculptors must have known much; far more than we.&nbsp; In a more
scientific civilisation there will be such a science once more:
but its laws, though still in the empiric stage, are not
altogether forgotten by some.&nbsp; Little children have often a
fine and clear instinct of them.&nbsp; Many cultivated and
experienced women have a fine and clear instinct of them
likewise.&nbsp; And some such would tell us that there is
intellect in plenty in the modern Nausicaa: but not of the
quality which they desire for their country&rsquo;s future
good.&nbsp; Self-consciousness, eagerness, volubility, petulance
in countenance, in gesture, and in voice&mdash;which last is too
often most harsh and artificial, the breath being sent forth
through the closed teeth, and almost entirely at the corners of
the mouth&mdash;and, with all this, a weariness often about the
wrinkling forehead and the drooping lids;&mdash;all these, which
are growing too common, not among the Demos only, nor only in the
towns, are signs, they think, of the unrest of unhealth,
physical, intellectual, spiritual.&nbsp; At least they are as
different as two types of physiognomy in the same race can be,
from the expression both of face and gesture, in those old Greek
sculptures, and in the old Italian painters; and, it must be
said, in the portraits of Reynolds, and Gainsborough, Copley, and
Romney.&nbsp; Not such, one thinks, must have been the mothers of
Britain during the latter half of the last century and the
beginning of the present; when their sons, at times, were holding
half the world at bay.</p>
<p>And if Nausicaa has become such in town: what is she when she
goes to the seaside, not to wash the clothes in fresh-water, but
herself in salt&mdash;the very salt-water, laden with decaying
organisms, from which, though not polluted further by a dozen
sewers, Ulysses had to cleanse himself, anointing, too, with oil,
ere he was fit to appear in the company of Nausicaa of
Greece?&nbsp; She dirties herself with the dirty saltwater; and
probably chills and tires herself by walking thither and back,
and staying in too long; and then flaunts on the pier, bedizened
in garments which, for monstrosity of form and disharmony of
colours, would have set that Greek Nausicaa&rsquo;s teeth on
edge, or those of any average Hindoo woman now.&nbsp; Or, even
sadder still, she sits on chairs and benches all the weary
afternoon, her head drooped on her chest, over some novel from
the &ldquo;Library;&rdquo; and then returns to tea and shrimps,
and lodgings of which the fragrance is not unsuggestive,
sometimes not unproductive, of typhoid fever.&nbsp; Ah, poor
Nausicaa of England!&nbsp; That is a sad sight to some who think
about the present, and have read about the past.&nbsp; It is not
a sad sight to see your old father&mdash;tradesman, or clerk, or
what not&mdash;who has done good work in his day, and hopes to do
some more, sitting by your old mother, who has done good work in
her day&mdash;among the rest, that heaviest work of all, the
bringing you into the world and keeping you in it till
now&mdash;honest, kindly, cheerful folk enough, and not
inefficient in their own calling; though an average Northumbrian,
or Highlander, or Irish Easterling, beside carrying a brain of
five times the intellectual force, could drive five such men over
the cliff with his bare hands.&nbsp; It is not a sad sight, I
say, to see them sitting about upon those seaside benches,
looking out listlessly at the water, and the ships, and the
sunlight, and enjoying, like so many flies upon a wall, the novel
act of doing nothing.&nbsp; It is not the old for whom wise men
are sad: but for you.&nbsp; Where is your vitality?&nbsp; Where
is your &ldquo;Lebens-gl&uuml;ckseligkeit,&rdquo; your enjoyment
of superfluous life and power?&nbsp; Why you cannot even dance
and sing, till now and then, at night, perhaps, when you ought to
lie safe in bed, but when the weak brain, after receiving the
day&rsquo;s nourishment, has roused itself a second time into a
false excitement of gaslight pleasure.&nbsp; What there is left
of it is all going into that foolish book, which the womanly
element in you, still healthy and alive, delights in; because it
places you in fancy in situations in which you will never stand,
and inspires you with emotions, some of which, it may be, you had
better never feel.&nbsp; Poor Nausicaa&mdash;old, some men think,
before you have been ever young.</p>
<p>And now they are going to &ldquo;develop&rdquo; you; and let
you have your share in &ldquo;the higher education of
women,&rdquo; by making you read more books, and do more sums,
and pass examinations, and stoop over desks at night after
stooping over some other employment all day; and to teach you
Latin, and even Greek!</p>
<p>Well, we will gladly teach you Greek, if you learn thereby to
read the history of Nausicaa of old, and what manner of maiden
she was, and what was her education.&nbsp; You will admire her,
doubtless.&nbsp; But do not let your admiration limit itself to
drawing a meagre half-medi&aelig;valised design of her&mdash;as
she never looked.&nbsp; Copy in your own person; and even if you
do not descend as low&mdash;or rise as high&mdash;as washing the
household clothes, at least learn to play at ball; and sing, in
the open air and sunshine, not in theatres and concert-rooms by
gaslight; and take decent care of your own health; and dress not
like a &ldquo;Parisienne&rdquo;&mdash;nor, of course, like
Nausicaa of old, for that is to ask too much:&mdash;but somewhat
more like an average Highland lassie; and try to look like her,
and be like her, of whom Wordsworth sang:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
mien and face<br />
In which full plainly I can trace<br />
Benignity, and home-bred sense,<br />
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br />
Here scattered, like a random seed,<br />
Remote from men, thou dost not need<br />
The embarrassed look of shy distress<br />
And maidenly shamefacedness.<br />
Thou wear&rsquo;st upon thy forehead clear<br />
The freedom of a mountaineer.<br />
A face with gladness overspread,<br />
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred,<br />
And seemliness complete, that sways<br />
Thy courtesies, about thee plays.<br />
With no restraint, save such as springs<br />
From quick and eager visitings<br />
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br />
Of thy few words of English speech.<br />
A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife<br />
That gives thy gestures grace and life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yet unspoilt Nausicaa of the North; descendant of the dark
tender-hearted Celtic girl, and the fair deep-hearted
Scandinavian Viking, thank God for thy heather and fresh air, and
the kine thou tendest, and the wool thou spinnest; and come not
to seek thy fortune, child, in wicked London town; nor import, as
they tell me thou art doing fast, the ugly fashions of that
London town, clumsy copies of Parisian cockneydom, into thy
Highland home; nor give up the healthful and graceful, free and
modest dress of thy mother and thy mother&rsquo;s mother, to
disfigure the little kirk on Sabbath days with crinoline and
corset, high-heeled boots, and other women&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>It is proposed, just now, to assimilate the education of girls
more and more to that of boys.&nbsp; If that means that girls are
merely to learn more lessons, and to study what their brothers
are taught, in addition to what their mothers were taught; then
it is to be hoped, at least by physiologists and patriots, that
the scheme will sink into that limbo whither, in a free and
tolerably rational country, all imperfect and ill-considered
schemes are sure to gravitate.&nbsp; But if the proposal be a
bon&acirc;-fide one: then it must be borne in mind that in the
Public schools of England, and in all private schools, I presume,
which take their tone from them, cricket and football are more or
less compulsory, being considered integral parts of an
Englishman&rsquo;s education; and that they are likely to remain
so, in spite of all reclamations: because masters and boys alike
know that games do not, in the long run, interfere with a
boy&rsquo;s work; that the same boy will very often excel in
both; that the games keep him in health for his work; and the
spirit with which he takes to his games when in the lower school,
is a fair test of the spirit with which he will take to his work
when he rises into the higher school; and that nothing is worse
for a boy than to fall into that loafing, tuck-shop-haunting set,
who neither play hard nor work hard, and are usually extravagant,
and often vicious.&nbsp; Moreover, they know well that games
conduce, not merely to physical, but to moral health; that in the
playing-field boys acquire virtues which no books can give them;
not merely daring and endurance, but, better still, temper,
self-restraint, fairness, honour, unenvious approbation of
another&rsquo;s success, and all that &ldquo;give and take&rdquo;
of life which stand a man in such good stead when he goes forth
into the world, and without which, indeed, his success is always
maimed and partial.</p>
<p>Now: if the promoters of higher education for women will
compel girls to any training analogous to our public-school
games; if, for instance, they will insist on that most natural
and wholesome of all exercises, dancing, in order to develop the
lower half of the body; on singing, to expand the lungs and
regulate the breath; and on some games&mdash;ball or what
not&mdash;which will ensure that raised chest, and upright
carriage, and general strength of the upper torso, without which
full oxygenation of the blood, and therefore general health, is
impossible; if they will sternly forbid tight stays, high heels,
and all which interferes with free growth and free motion; if
they will consider carefully all which has been written on the
&ldquo;half-time system&rdquo; by Mr. Chadwick and others; and
accept the certain physical law that, in order to renovate the
brain day by day, the growing creature must have plenty of fresh
air and play, and that the child who learns for four hours and
plays for four hours, will learn more, and learn it more easily,
than the child who learns for the whole eight hours; if, in
short, they will teach girls not merely to understand the Greek
tongue, but to copy somewhat of the Greek physical training, of
that &ldquo;music and gymnastic&rdquo; which helped to make the
cleverest race of the old world the ablest race likewise; then
they will earn the gratitude of the patriot and the
physiologists, by doing their best to stay the downward
tendencies of the physique, and therefore ultimately of the
morale, in the coming generation of English women.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that, as yet, I hear of but one movement in
this direction among the promoters of the &ldquo;higher education
of women.&rdquo; <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; I trust that the subject will be
taken up methodically by those gifted ladies, who have acquainted
themselves, and are labouring to acquaint other women, with the
first principles of health; and that they may avail to prevent
the coming generations, under the unwholesome stimulant of
competitive examinations, and so forth, from
&ldquo;developing&rdquo; into so many
Chinese&mdash;dwarfs&mdash;or idiots.</p>

<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>THE
AIR-MOTHERS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">1869.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Die Natur ist die Bewegung</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> are these who follow us softly
over the moor in the autumn eve?&nbsp; Their wings brush and
rustle in the fir-boughs, and they whisper before us and behind,
as if they called gently to each other, like birds flocking
homeward to their nests.</p>
<p>The woodpecker on the pine-stems knows them, and laughs aloud
for joy as they pass.&nbsp; The rooks above the pasture know
them, and wheel round and tumble in their play.&nbsp; The brown
leaves on the oak trees know them, and flutter faintly, and
beckon as they pass.&nbsp; And in the chattering of the dry
leaves there is a meaning, and a cry of weary things which long
for rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us home, take us home, you soft air-mothers, now
our fathers the sunbeams are grown dull.&nbsp; Our green summer
beauty is all draggled, and our faces are grown wan and wan; and
the buds, the children whom we nourished, thrust us off,
ungrateful, from our seats.&nbsp; Waft us down, you soft
air-mothers, upon your wings to the quiet earth, that we may go
to our home, as all things go, and become air and sunlight once
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bold young fir-seeds know them, and rattle impatient
in their cones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blow stronger, blow fiercer, slow
air-mothers, and shake us from our prisons of dead wood, that we
may fly and spin away north-eastward, each on his horny
wing.&nbsp; Help us but to touch the moorland yonder, and we will
take good care of ourselves henceforth; we will dive like arrows
through the heather, and drive our sharp beaks into the soil, and
rise again as green trees toward the sunlight, and spread out
lusty boughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They never think, bold fools, of what is coming to bring them
low in the midst of their pride; of the reckless axe which will
fell them, and the saw which will shape them into logs; and the
trains which will roar and rattle over them, as they lie buried
in the gravel of the way, till they are ground and rotted into
powder, and dug up and flung upon the fire, that they too may
return home, like all things, and become air and sunlight once
again.</p>
<p>And the air-mothers hear their prayers, and do their bidding:
but faintly; for they themselves are tired and sad.</p>
<p>Tired and sad are the air-mothers, and their gardens rent and
wan.&nbsp; Look at them as they stream over the black forest,
before the dim south-western sun; long lines and wreaths of
melancholy grey, stained with dull yellow or dead dun.&nbsp; They
have come far across the seas, and done many a wild deed upon
their way; and now that they have reached the land, like
shipwrecked sailors, they will lie down and weep till they can
weep no more.</p>
<p>Ah, how different were those soft air-mothers when, invisible
to mortal eyes, they started on their long sky-journey, five
thousand miles across the sea!&nbsp; Out of the blazing caldron
which lies between the two New Worlds, they leapt up when the
great sun called them, in whirls and spouts of clear hot steam;
and rushed of their own passion to the northward, while the
whirling earth-ball whirled them east.&nbsp; So north-eastward
they rushed aloft, across the gay West Indian isles, leaving
below the glitter of the flying-fish, and the sidelong eyes of
cruel sharks; above the cane-fields and the plantain-gardens, and
the cocoa-groves which fringe the shores; above the rocks which
throbbed with earthquakes, and the peaks of old volcanoes,
cinder-strewn; while, far beneath, the ghosts of their dead
sisters hurried home upon the north-east breeze.</p>
<p>Wild deeds they did as they rushed onward, and struggled and
fought among themselves, up and down, and round and backward, in
the fury of their blind hot youth.&nbsp; They heeded not the tree
as they snapped it, nor the ship as they whelmed it in the waves;
nor the cry of the sinking sailor, nor the need of his little
ones on shore; hasty and selfish even as children, and, like
children, tamed by their own rage.&nbsp; For they tired
themselves by struggling with each other, and by tearing the
heavy water into waves; and their wings grew clogged with
sea-spray, and soaked more and more with steam.&nbsp; But at last
the sea grew cold beneath them, and their clear steam shrank to
mist; and they saw themselves and each other wrapped in dull
rain-laden clouds.&nbsp; Then they drew their white
cloud-garments round them, and veiled themselves for very shame;
and said: &ldquo;We have been wild and wayward; and, alas! our
pure bright youth is gone.&nbsp; But we will do one good deed yet
ere we die, and so we shall not have lived in vain.&nbsp; We will
glide onward to the land, and weep there; and refresh all things
with soft warm rain; and make the grass grow, the buds burst;
quench the thirst of man and beast, and wash the soiled world
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they are wandering past us, the air-mothers, to weep the
leaves into their graves; to weep the seeds into their seed-beds,
and weep the soil into the plains; to get the rich earth ready
for the winter, and then creep northward to the ice-world, and
there die.</p>
<p>Weary, and still more weary, slowly and more slowly still,
they will journey on far northward, across fast-chilling
seas.&nbsp; For a doom is laid upon them, never to be still
again, till they rest at the North Pole itself, the still axle of
the spinning world; and sink in death around it, and become white
snow-clad ghosts.</p>
<p>But will they live again, those chilled air-mothers?&nbsp;
Yes, they must live again.&nbsp; For all things move for ever;
and not even ghosts can rest.&nbsp; So the corpses of their
sisters, piling on them from above, press them outward, press
them southward toward the sun once more; across the floes and
round the icebergs, weeping tears of snow and sleet, while men
hate their wild harsh voices, and shrink before their bitter
breath.&nbsp; They know not that the cold bleak snow-storms, as
they hurtle from the black north-east, bear back the ghosts of
the soft air-mothers, as penitents, to their father, the great
sun.</p>
<p>But as they fly southwards, warm life thrills them, and they
drop their loads of sleet and snow; and meet their young live
sisters from the south, and greet them with flash and
thunder-peal.&nbsp; And, please God, before many weeks are over,
as we run Westward-Ho, we shall overtake the ghosts of these
air-mothers, hurrying back toward their father, the great
sun.&nbsp; Fresh and bright under the fresh bright heaven, they
will race with us toward our home, to gain new heat, new life,
new power, and set forth about their work once more.&nbsp; Men
call them the south-west wind, those air-mothers; and their
ghosts the north-east trade; and value them, and rightly, because
they bear the traders out and home across the sea.&nbsp; But wise
men, and little children, should look on them with more seeing
eyes; and say, &ldquo;May not these winds be living
creatures?&nbsp; They, too, are thoughts of God, to whom all
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For is not our life like their life?&nbsp; Do we not come and
go as they?&nbsp; Out of God&rsquo;s boundless bosom, the fount
of life, we came; through selfish, stormy youth and contrite
tears&mdash;just not too late; through manhood not altogether
useless; through slow and chill old age, we return from Whence we
came; to the Bosom of God once more&mdash;to go forth again, it
may be, with fresh knowledge, and fresh powers, to nobler
work.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>Such was the prophecy which I learnt, or seemed to learn, from
the south-western wind off the Atlantic, on a certain delectable
evening.&nbsp; And it was fulfilled at night, as far as the
gentle air-mothers could fulfil it, for foolish man.</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a roaring in the woods all night;<br />
The rain came heavily and fell in floods;<br />
But now the sun is rising calm and bright,<br />
The birds are singing in the distant woods;<br />
Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods,<br />
The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters,<br />
And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But was I a gloomy and distempered man, if, upon such a morn
as that, I stood on the little bridge across a certain brook, and
watched the water run, with something of a sigh?&nbsp; Or if,
when the schoolboy beside me lamented that the floods would
surely be out, and his day&rsquo;s fishing spoiled, I said to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, my boy, that is a little matter.&nbsp; Look
at what you are seeing now, and understand what barbarism and
waste mean.&nbsp; Look at all that beautiful water which God has
sent us hither off the Atlantic, without trouble or expense to
us.&nbsp; Thousands, and tens of thousands, of gallons will run
under this bridge to-day; and what shall we do with it?&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; And yet: think only of the mills which that water
would have turned.&nbsp; Think how it might have kept up health
and cleanliness in poor creatures packed away in the back streets
of the nearest town, or even in London itself.&nbsp; Think even
how country folks, in many parts of England, in three
months&rsquo; time, may be crying out for rain, and afraid of
short crops, and fever, and scarlatina, and cattle-plague, for
want of the very water which we are now letting run back, wasted,
into the sea from whence it came.&nbsp; And yet we call ourselves
a civilised people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not wise, I know, to preach to boys.&nbsp; And yet,
sometimes, a man must speak his heart; even, like Midas&rsquo;s
slave, to the reeds by the river side.&nbsp; And I had so often,
fishing up and down full many a stream, whispered my story to
those same river-reeds; and told them that my Lord the Sovereign
Demos had, like old Midas, asses&rsquo; ears in spite of all his
gold, that I thought I might for once tell it the boy likewise,
in hope that he might help his generation to mend that which my
own generation does not seem like to mend.</p>
<p>I might have said more to him: but did not.&nbsp; For it is
not well to destroy too early the child&rsquo;s illusion, that
people must be wise because they are grown up, and have votes,
and rule&mdash;or think they rule&mdash;the world.&nbsp; The
child will find out how true that is soon enough for
himself.&nbsp; If the truth be forced on him by the hot words of
those with whom he lives, it is apt to breed in him that
contempt, stormful and therefore barren, which makes revolutions;
and not that pity, calm and therefore helpful, which makes
reforms.</p>
<p>So I might have said to him, but did not&mdash;</p>
<p>And then men pray for rain:</p>
<p>My boy, did you ever hear the old Eastern legend about the
Gipsies?&nbsp; How they were such good musicians, that some great
Indian Sultan sent for the whole tribe, and planted them near his
palace, and gave them land, and ploughs to break it up, and seed
to sow it, that they might dwell there, and play and sing to
him.</p>
<p>But when the winter arrived, the Gipsies all came to the
Sultan, and cried that they were starving.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what
have you done with the seed-corn which I gave you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;O Light of the Age, we ate it in the summer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what have you done with the ploughs which I gave
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O Glory of the Universe, we burnt them
to bake the corn withal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said that great Sultan&mdash;&ldquo;Like the butterflies
you have lived; and like the butterflies you shall
wander.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he drove them out.&nbsp; And that is how
the Gipsies came hither from the East.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the Sultan of all Sultans, who sends the
rain, should make a like answer to us foolish human beings, when
we prayed for rain: &ldquo;But what have you done with the rain
which I gave you six months since?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
let it run into the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, ere you ask
for more rain, make places wherein you can keep it when you have
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But that would be, in most cases, too
expensive.&nbsp; We can employ our capital more profitably in
other directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not for me to say what answer might be made to such an
excuse.&nbsp; I think a child&rsquo;s still unsophisticated sense
of right and wrong would soon supply one; and probably
one&mdash;considering the complexity, and difficulty, and
novelty, of the whole question&mdash;somewhat too harsh; as
children&rsquo;s judgments are wont to be.</p>
<p>But would it not be well if our children, without being taught
to blame anyone for what is past, were taught something about
what ought to be done now, what must be done soon, with the
rainfall of these islands; and about other and kindred
health-questions, on the solution of which depends, and will
depend more and more, the life of millions?&nbsp; One would have
thought that those public schools and colleges which desire to
monopolise the education of the owners of the soil; of the great
employers of labour; of the clergy; and of all, indeed, who ought
to be acquainted with the duties of property, the conditions of
public health, and, in a word, with the general laws of what is
now called Social Science&mdash;one would have thought, I say,
that these public schools and colleges would have taught their
scholars somewhat at least about such matters, that they might go
forth into life with at least some rough notions of the causes
which make people healthy or unhealthy, rich or poor, comfortable
or wretched, useful or dangerous to the State.&nbsp; But as long
as our great educational institutions, safe, or fancying
themselves safe, in some enchanted castle, shut out by ancient
magic from the living world, put a premium on Latin and Greek
verses: a wise father will, during the holidays, talk now and
then, I hope, somewhat after this fashion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand, my boy, that all the water in the
country comes out of the sky, and from nowhere else; and that,
therefore, to save and store the water when it falls is a
question of life and death to crops, and man, and beast; for with
or without water is life or death.&nbsp; If I took, for instance,
the water from the moors above and turned it over yonder field, I
could double, and more than double, the crops in that field,
henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do I not do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because the field lies higher than the house; and
if&mdash;now here is one thing which you and every civilised man
should know&mdash;if you have water-meadows, or any
&lsquo;irrigated&rsquo; land, as it is called, above a house, or,
even on a level with it, it is certain to breed not merely cold
and damp, but fever or ague.&nbsp; Our forefathers did not
understand this; and they built their houses, as this is built,
in the lowest places they could find: sometimes because they
wanted to be near ponds, from whence they could get fish in Lent;
but more often, I think, because they wanted to be sheltered from
the wind.&nbsp; They had no glass, as we have, in their windows,
or, at least, only latticed casements, which let in the wind and
cold; and they shrank from high and exposed, and therefore really
healthy, spots.&nbsp; But now that we have good glass, and sash
windows, and doors that will shut tight, we can build warm houses
where we like.&nbsp; And if you ever have to do with the building
of cottages, remember that it is your duty to the people who will
live in them, and therefore to the State, to see that they stand
high and dry, where no water can drain down into their
foundations, and where fog, and the poisonous gases which are
given out by rotting vegetables, cannot drain down either.&nbsp;
You will learn more about all that when you learn, as every
civilised lad should in these days, something about chemistry,
and the laws of fluids and gases.&nbsp; But you know already that
flowers are cut off by frost in the low grounds sooner than in
the high; and that the fog at night always lies along the brooks;
and that the sour moor-smell which warns us to shut our windows
at sunset, comes down from the hill, and not up from the
valley.&nbsp; Now all these things are caused by one and the same
law; that cold air is heavier than warm; and, therefore, like so
much water, must run down-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the rainfall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have wandered a little from the rainfall:
though not as far as you fancy; for fever and ague and rheumatism
usually mean&mdash;rain in the wrong place.&nbsp; But if you knew
how much illness, and torturing pain, and death, and sorrow
arise, even to this very day, from ignorance of these simple
laws, then you would bear them carefully in mind, and wish to
know more about them.&nbsp; But now for water being life to the
beasts.&nbsp; Do you remember&mdash;though you are hardly old
enough&mdash;the cattle-plague?&nbsp; How the beasts died, or had
to be killed and buried, by tens of thousands; and how misery and
ruin fell on hundreds of honest men and women over many of the
richest counties of England: but how we in this vale had no
cattle-plague; and how there was none&mdash;as far as I
recollect&mdash;in the uplands of Devon and Cornwall, nor of
Wales, nor of the Scotch Highlands?&nbsp; Now, do you know why
that was?&nbsp; Simply because we here, like those other
up-landers, are in such a country as Palestine was before the
foolish Jews cut down all their timber, and so destroyed their
own rainfall&mdash;a &lsquo;land of brooks of water, of fountains
and depths that spring out of valleys and hills.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is hardly a field here that has not, thank God, its running
brook, or its sweet spring, from which our cattle were drinking
their health and life, while in the clay-lands of Cheshire, and
in the Cambridgeshire fens&mdash;which were drained utterly
dry&mdash;the poor things drank no water, too often, save that of
the very same putrid ponds in which they had been standing all
day long, to cool themselves, and to keep off the flies.&nbsp; I
do not say, of course, that bad water caused the
cattle-plague.&nbsp; It came by infection from the East of
Europe.&nbsp; But I say that bad water made the cattle ready to
take it, and made it spread over the country; and when you are
old enough I will give you plenty of proof&mdash;some from the
herds of your own kinsmen&mdash;that what I say is
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for pure water being life to human beings: why
have we never fever here, and scarcely ever diseases like
fever&mdash;zymotics, as the doctors call them?&nbsp; Or, if a
case comes into our parish from outside, why does the fever never
spread?&nbsp; For the very same reason that we had no
cattle-plague.&nbsp; Because we have more pure water close to
every cottage than we need.&nbsp; And this I tell you: that the
only two outbreaks of deadly disease which we have had here for
thirty years, were both of them, as far as I could see, to be
traced to filthy water having got into the poor folks&rsquo;
wells.&nbsp; Water, you must remember, just as it is life when
pure, is death when foul.&nbsp; For it can carry, unseen to the
eve, and even when it looks clear and sparkling, and tastes soft
and sweet, poisons which have perhaps killed more human beings
than ever were killed in battle.&nbsp; You have read, perhaps,
how the Athenians, when they were dying of the plague, accused
the Laced&aelig;monians outside the walls of poisoning their
wells; or how, in some of the pestilences of the Middle Ages, the
common people used to accuse the poor harmless Jews of poisoning
the wells, and set upon them and murdered them horribly.&nbsp;
They were right, I do not doubt, in their notion that the
well-water was giving them the pestilence: but they had not sense
to see that they were poisoning the wells themselves by their
dirt and carelessness; or, in the case of poor besieged Athens,
probably by mere overcrowding, which has cost many a life ere
now, and will cost more.&nbsp; And I am sorry to tell you, my
little man, that even now too many people have no more sense than
they had, and die in consequence.&nbsp; If you could see a
battle-field, and men shot down, writhing and dying in hundreds
by shell and bullet, would not that seem to you a horrid
sight?&nbsp; Then&mdash;I do not wish to make you sad too early,
but this is a fact that everyone should know&mdash;that more
people, and not strong men only, but women and little children
too, are killed and wounded in Great Britain every year by bad
water and want of water together, than were killed and wounded in
any battle which has been fought since you were born.&nbsp;
Medical men know this well.&nbsp; And when you are older, you may
see it for yourself in the Registrar-General&rsquo;s reports,
blue-books, pamphlets, and so on, without end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do not people stop such a horrible loss of
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear boy, the true causes of it have only been
known for the last thirty or forty years; and we English are, as
good King Alfred found us to his sorrow a thousand years ago,
very slow to move, even when we see a thing ought to be
done.&nbsp; Let us hope that in this matter&mdash;we have been so
in most matters as yet&mdash;we shall be like the tortoise in the
fable, and not the hare; and by moving slowly, but surely, win
the race at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now think for yourself: and see what you would do
to save these people from being poisoned by bad water.&nbsp;
Remember that the plain question is this: The rain-water comes
down from heaven as water, and nothing but water.&nbsp;
Rain-water is the only pure water, after all.&nbsp; How would you
save that for the poor people who have none?&nbsp; There; run
away and hunt rabbits on the moor: but look, meanwhile, how you
would save some of this beautiful and precious water which is
roaring away into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&nbsp; What would you do?&nbsp; Make ponds, you
say, like the old monks&rsquo; ponds, now all broken down.&nbsp;
Dam all the glens across their mouths, and turn them into
reservoirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Out of the mouths of babes and
sucklings&rsquo;&mdash;Well, that will have to be done.&nbsp;
That is being done more and more, more or less well.&nbsp; The
good people of Glasgow did it first, I think; and now the good
people of Manchester, and of other northern towns, have done it,
and have saved many a human life thereby already.&nbsp; But it
must be done, some day, all over England and Wales, and great
part of Scotland.&nbsp; For the mountain tops and moors, my boy,
by a beautiful law of nature, compensate for their own poverty by
yielding a wealth which the rich lowlands cannot yield.&nbsp; You
do not understand?&nbsp; Then see.&nbsp; Yon moor above can grow
neither corn nor grass.&nbsp; But one thing it can grow, and does
grow, without which we should have no corn nor grass, and that
is&mdash;water.&nbsp; Not only does far more rain fall up there
than falls here down below, but even in drought the high moors
condense the moisture into dew, and so yield some water, even
when the lowlands are burnt up with drought.&nbsp; The reason of
that you must learn hereafter.&nbsp; That it is so, you should
know yourself.&nbsp; For on the high chalk downs, you know, where
farmers make a sheep-pond, they never, if they are wise, make it
in a valley or on a hillside, but on the bleakest top of the very
highest down; and there, if they can once get it filled with snow
and rain in winter, the blessed dews of night will keep some
water in it all the summer through, while the ponds below are
utterly dried up.&nbsp; And even so it is, as I know, with this
very moor.&nbsp; Corn and grass it will not grow, because there
is too little &lsquo;staple,&rsquo; that is, soluble minerals, in
the sandy soil.&nbsp; But how much water it might grow, you may
judge roughly for yourself, by remembering how many brooks like
this are running off it now to carry mere dirt into the river,
and then into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should we not make dams at once; and save the
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we cannot afford it.&nbsp; No one would buy the
water when we had stored it.&nbsp; The rich in town and country
will always take care&mdash;and quite right they are&mdash;to
have water enough for themselves, and for their servants too,
whatever it may cost them.&nbsp; But the poorer people
are&mdash;and therefore usually, alas! the more
ignorant&mdash;the less water they get; and the less they care to
have water; and the less they are inclined to pay for it; and the
more, I am sorry to say, they waste what little they do get; and
I am still more sorry to say, spoil, and even steal and
sell&mdash;in London at least&mdash;the stop-cocks and lead-pipes
which bring the water into their houses.&nbsp; So that keeping a
water-shop is a very troublesome and uncertain business; and one
which is not likely to pay us or anyone round here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not let some company manage it, as they manage
railways, and gas, and other things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;you have been overhearing a good deal about
companies of late, I see.&nbsp; But this I will tell you; that
when you grow up, and have a vote and influence, it will be your
duty, if you intend to be a good citizen, not only not to put the
water-supply of England into the hands of fresh companies, but to
help to take out of their hands what water-supply they manage
already, especially in London; and likewise the gas-supply; and
the railroads; and everything else, in a word, which everybody
uses, and must use.&nbsp; For you must understand&mdash;at least
as soon as you can&mdash;that though the men who make up
companies are no worse than other men, and some of them, as you
ought to know, very good men; yet what they have to look to is
their profits; and the less water they supply, and the worse it
is, the more profit they make.&nbsp; For most water, I am sorry
to say, is fouled before the water companies can get to it, as
this water which runs past us will be, and as the Thames water
above London is.&nbsp; Therefore it has to be cleansed, or partly
cleansed, at a very great expense.&nbsp; So water companies have
to be inspected&mdash;in plain English, watched&mdash;at a very
heavy expense to the nation by Government officers; and compelled
to do their best, and take their utmost care.&nbsp; And so it has
come to pass that the London water is not now nearly as bad as
some of it was thirty years ago, when it was no more fit to drink
than that in the cattle-yard tank.&nbsp; But still we must have
more water, and better, in London; for it is growing year by
year.&nbsp; There are more than three millions of people already
in what we call London; and ere you are an old man there may be
between four and five millions.&nbsp; Now to supply all these
people with water is a duty which we must not leave to any
private companies.&nbsp; It must be done by a public authority,
as is fit and proper in a free self-governing country.&nbsp; In
this matter, as in all others, we will try to do what the Royal
Commission told us four years ago we ought to do.&nbsp; I hope
that you will see, though I may not, the day when what we call
London, but which is really nine-tenths of it, only a great nest
of separate villages huddled together, will be divided into three
great self-governing cities, London, Westminster, and Southwark;
each with its own corporation, like that of the venerable and
well-governed city of London; each managing its own water-supply,
gas-supply, and sewage, and other matters besides; and managing
them, like Dublin, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and other
great northern towns, far more cheaply and far better than any
companies can do it for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where shall we get water enough for all these
millions of people?&nbsp; There are no mountains near
London.&nbsp; But we might give them the water off our
moors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my boy,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He that will not when he may,<br />
When he will, he shall have nay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some fifteen years ago the Londoners might have had water from
us; and I was one of those who did my best to get it for them:
but the water companies did not choose to take it; and now this
part of England is growing so populous and so valuable that it
wants all its little rainfall for itself.&nbsp; So there is
another leaf torn out of the Sibylline books for the poor old
water companies.&nbsp; You do not understand: you will some
day.&nbsp; But you may comfort yourself about London.&nbsp; For
it happens to be, I think, the luckiest city in the world; and if
it had not been, we should have had pestilence on pestilence in
it, as terrible as the great plague of Charles II.&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; The old Britons, without knowing in the least what
they were doing, settled old London city in the very centre of
the most wonderful natural reservoir in this island, or perhaps
in all Europe; which reaches from Kent into Wiltshire, and round
again into Suffolk; and that is, the dear old chalk
downs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they are always dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But the turf on them never burns up, and the
streams which flow through them never run dry, and seldom or
never flood either.&nbsp; Do you not know, from Winchester, that
that is true?&nbsp; Then where is all the rain and snow gone,
which falls on them year by year, but into the chalk itself, and
into the green-sands, too, below the chalk?&nbsp; There it is,
soaked up as by a sponge, in quantity incalculable; enough, some
think, to supply London, let it grow as huge as it may.&nbsp; I
wish I too were sure of that.&nbsp; But the Commission has shown
itself so wise and fair, and brave likewise&mdash;too brave, I am
sorry to say, for some who might have supported them&mdash;that
it is not for me to gainsay their opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if there was not water enough in the chalk, are not
the Londoners rich enough to bring it from any
distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, in this also we will agree with the
Commission&mdash;that we ought not to rob Peter to pay Paul, and
take water to a distance which other people close at hand may
want.&nbsp; Look at the map of England and southern Scotland; and
see for yourself what is just, according to geography and
nature.&nbsp; There are four mountain-ranges; four great
water-fields.&nbsp; First, the hills of the Border.&nbsp; Their
rainfall ought to be stored for the Lothians and the extreme
north of England.&nbsp; Then the Yorkshire and Derbyshire
Hills&mdash;the central chine of England.&nbsp; Their rainfall is
being stored already, to the honour of the shrewd northern men,
for the manufacturing counties east and west of the hills.&nbsp;
Then come the Lake mountains&mdash;the finest water-field of all,
because more rain by far falls there than in any place in
England.&nbsp; But they will be wanted to supply Lancashire, and
some day Liverpool itself; for Liverpool is now using rain which
belongs more justly to other towns; and besides, there are plenty
of counties and towns, down into Cheshire, which would be glad of
what water Lancashire does not want.&nbsp; At last come the
Snowdon mountains, a noble water-field, which I know well; for an
old dream of mine has been, that ere I died I should see all the
rain of the Carnedds, and the Glyders, and Siabod, and Snowdon
itself, carried across the Conway river to feed the mining
districts of North Wales, where the streams are now all foul with
oil and lead; and then on into the western coal and iron fields,
to Wolverhampton and Birmingham itself: and if I were the
engineer who got that done, I should be happier&mdash;prouder I
dare not say&mdash;than if I had painted nobler pictures than
Raffaelle, or written nobler plays than Shakespeare.&nbsp; I say
that, boy, in most deliberate earnest.&nbsp; But meanwhile, do
you not see that in districts where coal and iron may be found,
and fresh manufactures may spring up any day in any place, each
district has a right to claim the nearest rainfall for
itself?&nbsp; And now, when we have got the water into its proper
place, let us see what we shall do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you say &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&nbsp; Can you and
I do all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, are not you and I free citizens; part of the
people, the Commons&mdash;as the good old word runs&mdash;of this
country?&nbsp; And are we not&mdash;or ought we not to be in
time&mdash;beside that, educated men?&nbsp; By the people,
remember, I mean, not only the hand-working man who has just got
a vote; I mean the clergy of all denominations; and the gentlemen
of the press; and last, but not least, the scientific men.&nbsp;
If those four classes together were to tell every
government&mdash;&lsquo;Free water we will have, and as much as
we reasonably choose;&rsquo; and tell every candidate for the
House of Commons: &lsquo;Unless you promise to get us as much
free water as we reasonably choose, we will not return you to
Parliament:&rsquo; then, I think, we four should put such a
&lsquo;pressure&rsquo; on Government as no water companies, or
other vested interests, could long resist.&nbsp; And if any of
those four classes should hang back, and waste their time and
influence over matters far less important and less pressing, the
other three must laugh at them, and more than laugh at them; and
ask them: &lsquo;Why have you education, why have you influence,
why have you votes, why are you freemen and not slaves, if not to
preserve the comfort, the decency, the health, the lives of men,
women, and children&mdash;most of those latter your own wives and
your own children?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do with the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, that is a more practical matter than
speculations grounded on the supposition that all classes will do
their duty.&nbsp; But the first thing we will do will be to give
to the very poorest houses a constant supply, at high pressure;
so that everybody may take as much water as he likes, instead of
having to keep the water in little cisterns, where it gets foul
and putrid only too often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will they not waste it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far from it, wherever the water has been laid on at
high pressure, the waste, which is terrible now&mdash;some say
that in London one-third of the water is wasted&mdash;begins to
lessen; and both water and expense are saved.&nbsp; If you will
only think, you will see one reason why.&nbsp; If a woman leaves
a high-pressure tap running, she will flood her place and her
neighbour&rsquo;s too.&nbsp; She will be like the
magician&rsquo;s servant, who called up the demon to draw water
for him; and so he did: but when he had begun he would not stop,
and if the magician had not come home, man and house would have
been washed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it saves money, why do not the water companies
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;and really here there are many excuses
for the poor old water companies, when so many of them swerve and
gib at the very mention of constant water-supply, like a poor
horse set to draw a load which he feels is too heavy for
him&mdash;because, to keep everything in order among dirty,
careless, and often drunken people, there must be officers with
lawful authority&mdash;water-policemen we will call
them&mdash;who can enter people&rsquo;s houses when they will,
and if they find anything wrong with the water, set it to rights
with a high hand, and even summon the people who have set it
wrong.&nbsp; And that is a power which, in a free country, must
never be given to the servants of any private company, but only
to the officers of a corporation or of the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do with the rest of the
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall have, I believe, so much to spare that
we may at least do this: In each district of each city, and the
centre of each town, we may build public baths and lavatories,
where poor men and women may get their warm baths when they will;
for now they usually never bathe at all, because they will
not&mdash;and ought not, if they be hard-worked folk&mdash;bathe
in cold water during nine months of the year.&nbsp; And there
they shall wash their clothes, and dry them by steam; instead of
washing them as now, at home, either under back sheds, where they
catch cold and rheumatism, or too often, alas! in their own
living rooms, in an atmosphere of foul vapour, which drives the
father to the public-house and the children into the streets; and
which not only prevents the clothes from being thoroughly dried
again, but is, my dear boy, as you will know when you are older,
a very hot-bed of disease.&nbsp; And they shall have other
comforts, and even luxuries, these public lavatories; and be
made, in time, graceful and refining, as well as merely
useful.&nbsp; Nay, we will even, I think, have in front of each
of them a real fountain; not like the
drinking-fountains&mdash;though they are great and needful
boons&mdash;which you see here and there about the streets, with
a tiny dribble of water to a great deal of expensive stone: but
real fountains, which shall leap, and sparkle, and plash, and
gurgle; and fill the place with life, and light, and coolness;
and sing in the people&rsquo;s ears the sweetest of all earthly
songs&mdash;save the song of a mother over her child&mdash;the
song of &lsquo;The Laughing Water.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will not that be a waste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy.&nbsp; And for that very reason, I think
we, the people, will have our fountains; if it be but to make our
governments, and corporations, and all public bodies and
officers, remember that they all&mdash;save Her Majesty the
Queen&mdash;are our servants, and not we theirs; and that we
choose to have water, not only to wash with, but to play with, if
we like.&nbsp; And I believe&mdash;for the world, as you will
find, is full not only of just but of generous souls&mdash;that
if the water-supply were set really right, there would be found,
in many a city, many a generous man who, over and above his
compulsory water-rate, would give his poor fellow-townsmen such a
real fountain as those which ennoble the great square at
Carcasonne and the great square at Nismes; to be &lsquo;a thing
of beauty and a joy for ever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, if you want to go back to your Latin and
Greek, you shall translate for me into Latin&mdash;I do not
expect you to do it into Greek, though it would turn very well
into Greek, for the Greeks know all about the matter long before
the Romans&mdash;what follows here; and you shall verify the
facts and the names, etc., in it from your dictionaries of
antiquity and biography, that you may remember all the better
what it says.&nbsp; And by that time, I think, you will have
learnt something more useful to yourself, and, I hope, to your
country hereafter, than if you had learnt to patch together the
neatest Greek and Latin verses which have appeared since the days
of Mr. Canning.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I have often amused myself, by fancying one question which an
old Roman emperor would ask, were he to rise from his grave and
visit the sights of London under the guidance of some minister of
state.&nbsp; The august shade would, doubtless, admire our
railroads and bridges, our cathedrals and our public parks, and
much more of which we need not be ashamed.&nbsp; But after
awhile, I think, he would look round, whether in London or in
most of our great cities, inquiringly and in vain, for one class
of buildings, which in his empire were wont to be almost as
conspicuous and as splendid, because, in public opinion, almost
as necessary, as the basilicas and temples: &ldquo;And
where,&rdquo; he would ask, &ldquo;are your public
baths?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if the minister of state who was his
guide should answer: &ldquo;Oh great C&aelig;sar, I really do not
know.&nbsp; I believe there are some somewhere at the back of
that ugly building which we call the National Gallery; and I
think there have been some meetings lately in the East End, and
an amateur concert at the Albert Hall, for restoring, by private
subscriptions, some baths and wash-houses in Bethnal Green, which
had fallen to decay.&nbsp; And there may be two or three more
about the metropolis; for parish vestries have powers by Act of
Parliament to establish such places, if they think fit, and
choose to pay for them out of the rates.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, I
think, the august shade might well make answer: &ldquo;We used to
call you, in old Rome, northern barbarians.&nbsp; It seems that
you have not lost all your barbarian habits.&nbsp; Are you aware
that, in every city in the Roman empire, there were, as a matter
of course, public baths open, not only to the poorest freeman,
but to the slave, usually for the payment of the smallest current
coin, and often gratuitously?&nbsp; Are you aware that in Rome
itself, millionaire after millionaire, emperor after emperor,
from Menenius Agrippa and Nero down to Diocletian and
Constantine, built baths, and yet more baths; and connected with
them gymnasia for exercise, lecture-rooms, libraries, and
porticoes, wherein the people might have shade, and shelter, and
rest?&nbsp; I remark, by-the-bye, that I have not seen in all
your London a single covered place in which the people may take
shelter during a shower.&nbsp; Are you aware that these baths
were of the most magnificent architecture, decorated with
marbles, paintings, sculptures, fountains, what not?&nbsp; And
yet I had heard, in Hades down below, that you prided yourselves
here on the study of the learned languages; and, indeed, taught
little but Greek and Latin at your public schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, if the minister should make reply: &ldquo;Oh yes, we
know all this.&nbsp; Even since the revival of letters in the end
of the fifteenth century a whole literature has been
written&mdash;a great deal of it, I fear, by pedants who seldom
washed even their hands and faces&mdash;about your Greek and
Roman baths.&nbsp; We visit their colossal ruins in Italy and
elsewhere with awe and admiration; and the discovery of a new
Roman bath in any old city of our isles sets all our antiquaries
buzzing with interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; the shade might ask, &ldquo;do you not
copy an example which you so much admire?&nbsp; Surely England
must be much in want, either of water, or of fuel to heat it
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, our rainfall is almost too great; our
soil so damp that we have had to invent a whole art of subsoil
drainage unknown to you; while, as for fuel, our coal-mines make
us the great fuel-exporting people of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a quiet sneer might curl the lip of a Constantine as he
replied: &ldquo;Not in vain, as I said, did we call you, some
fifteen hundred years ago, the barbarians of the north.&nbsp; But
tell me, good barbarian, whom I know to be both brave and
wise&mdash;for the fame of your young British empire has reached
us even in the realms below, and we recognise in you, with all
respect, a people more like us Romans than any which has appeared
on earth for many centuries&mdash;how is it you have forgotten
that sacred duty of keeping the people clean, which you surely at
one time learnt from us?&nbsp; When your ancestors entered our
armies, and rose, some of them, to be great generals, and even
emperors, like those two Teuton peasants, Justin and Justinian,
who, long after my days, reigned in my own Constantinople: then,
at least, you saw baths, and used them; and felt, after the bath,
that you were civilised men, and not &lsquo;sordidi ac
foetentes,&rsquo; as we used to call you when fresh out of your
bullock-waggons and cattle-pens.&nbsp; How is it that you have
forgotten that lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister, I fear, would have to answer that our ancestors
were barbarous enough, not only to destroy the Roman cities, and
temples, and basilicas, and statues, but the Roman baths
likewise; and then retired, each man to his own freehold in the
country, to live a life not much more cleanly or more graceful
than that of the swine which were his favourite food.&nbsp; But
he would have a right to plead, as an excuse, that not only in
England, but throughout the whole of the conquered Latin empire,
the Latin priesthood, who, in some respects, were&mdash;to their
honour&mdash;the representatives of Roman civilisation and the
protectors of its remnants, were the determined enemies of its
cleanliness; that they looked on personal dirt&mdash;like the old
hermits of the Thebaid&mdash;as a sign of sanctity; and
discouraged&mdash;as they are said to do still in some of the
Romance countries of Europe&mdash;the use of the bath, as not
only luxurious, but also indecent.</p>
<p>At which answer, it seems to me, another sneer might curl the
lip of the august shade, as he said to himself: &ldquo;This, at
least, I did not expect, when I made Christianity the state
religion of my empire.&nbsp; But you, good barbarian, look clean
enough.&nbsp; You do not look on dirt as a sign of
sanctity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, sire, the upper classes of our empire
boast of being the cleanliest&mdash;perhaps the only perfectly
cleanly&mdash;people in the world: except, of course, the savages
of the South Seas.&nbsp; And dirt is so far from being a thing
which we admire, that our scientific men&mdash;than whom the
world has never seen wiser&mdash;have proved to us, for a whole
generation past, that dirt is the fertile cause of disease and
drunkenness, misery, and recklessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, therefore,&rdquo; replies the shade, ere he
disappears, &ldquo;of discontent and revolution: followed by a
tyranny endured, as in Rome and many another place, by men once
free; because tyranny will at least do for them what they are too
lazy, and cowardly, and greedy, to do for themselves.&nbsp;
Farewell, and prosper; as you seem likely to prosper, on the
whole.&nbsp; But if you wish me to consider you a civilised
nation: let me hear that you have brought a great river from the
depths of the earth, be they a thousand fathoms deep, or from
your nearest mountains, be they five hundred miles away; and have
washed out London&rsquo;s dirt&mdash;and your own shame.&nbsp;
Till then, abstain from judging too harshly a Constantine, or
even a Caracalla; for they, whatever were their sins, built
baths, and kept their people clean.&nbsp; But do your
gymnasia&mdash;your schools and universities, teach your youth
naught about all this?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>THE
TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> more I have contemplated that
ancient story of the Fall, the more it has seemed to me within
the range of probability, and even of experience.&nbsp; It must
have happened somewhere for the first time; for it has happened
only too many times since.&nbsp; It has happened, as far as I can
ascertain, in every race, and every age, and every grade of
civilisation.&nbsp; It is happening round us now in every region
of the globe.&nbsp; Always and everywhere, it seems to me, have
poor human beings been tempted to eat of some &ldquo;tree of
knowledge,&rdquo; that they may be, even for an hour, as gods;
wise, but with a false wisdom; careless, but with a frantic
carelessness; and happy, but with a happiness which, when the
excitement is past, leaves too often&mdash;as with that hapless
pair in Eden&mdash;depression, shame, and fear.&nbsp; Everywhere,
and in all ages, as far as I can ascertain, has man been
inventing stimulants and narcotics to supply that want of
vitality of which he is so painfully aware; and has asked nature,
and not God, to clear the dull brain, and comfort the weary
spirit.</p>
<p>This has been, and will be perhaps for many a century to come,
almost the most fearful failing of this poor, exceptional,
over-organised, diseased, and truly fallen being called Man, who
is in doubt daily whether he be a god or an ape; and in trying
wildly to become the former, ends but too often in becoming the
latter.</p>
<p>For man, whether savage or civilised, feels, and has felt in
every age, that there is something wrong with him.&nbsp; He
usually confesses this fact&mdash;as is to be expected&mdash;of
his fellow-men, rather than of himself; and shows his sense that
there is something wrong with them by complaining of, hating, and
killing them.&nbsp; But he cannot always conceal from himself the
fact that he, too, is wrong, as well as they; and as he will not
usually kill himself, he tries wild ways to make himself at least
feel&mdash;if not to be&mdash;somewhat
&ldquo;better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Philosophers may bid him be content;
and tell him that he is what he ought to be, and what nature has
made him.&nbsp; But he cares nothing for the philosophers.&nbsp;
He knows, usually, that he is not what he ought to be; that he
carries about with him, in most cases, a body more or less
diseased and decrepit, incapable of doing all the work which he
feels that he himself could do, or expressing all the emotions
which he himself longs to express; a dull brain and dull senses,
which cramp the eager infinity within him; as&mdash;so Goethe
once said with pity&mdash;the horse&rsquo;s single hoof cramps
the fine intelligence and generosity of his nature, and forbids
him even to grasp an object, like the more stupid cat, and baser
monkey.&nbsp; And man has a self, too, within, from which he
longs too often to escape, as from a household ghost; who pulls
out, at unfortunately rude and unwelcome hours, the ledger of
memory.&nbsp; And so when the tempter&mdash;be he who he
may&mdash;says to him, &ldquo;Take this, and you will &lsquo;feel
better.&rsquo;&nbsp; Take this, and you shall be as gods, knowing
good and evil:&rdquo; then, if the temptation was, as the old
story says, too much for man while healthy and unfallen, what
must it be for his unhealthy and fallen children?</p>
<p>In vain we say to man:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis life, not death, for which you pant;<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis life, whereof your nerves are scant;<br />
More life, and fuller, that you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And your tree of knowledge is not the tree of life: it is in
every case, the tree of death; of decrepitude, madness,
misery.&nbsp; He prefers the voice of the tempter: &ldquo;Thou
shalt not surely die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, he will say at last:
&ldquo;Better be as gods awhile, and die: than be the crawling,
insufficient thing I am; and live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&mdash;did I say?&nbsp; Alas! I must say she likewise.&nbsp;
The sacred story is only too true to fact, when it represents the
woman as falling, not merely at the same time as the man, but
before the man.&nbsp; Only let us remember that it represents the
woman as tempted; tempted, seemingly, by a rational being, of
lower race, and yet of superior cunning; who must, therefore,
have fallen before the woman.&nbsp; Who or what the being was,
who is called the Serpent in our translation of Genesis, it is
not for me to say.&nbsp; We have absolutely, I think, no facts
from which to judge; and Rabbinical traditions need trouble no
man much.&nbsp; But I fancy that a missionary, preaching on this
story to Negroes; telling them plainly that the
&ldquo;Serpent&rdquo; meant the first Obeah man; and then
comparing the experiences of that hapless pair in Eden, with
their own after certain orgies not yet extinct in Africa and
elsewhere, would be only too well understood: so well, indeed,
that he might run some risk of eating himself, not of the tree of
life, but of that of death.&nbsp; The sorcerer or sorceress
tempting the woman; and then the woman tempting the man; this
seems to be, certainly among savage peoples, and, alas! too often
among civilised peoples also, the usual course of the world-wide
tragedy.</p>
<p>But&mdash;paradoxical as it may seem&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s
yielding before the man is not altogether to her dishonour, as
those old monks used to allege who hated, and too often tortured,
the sex whom they could not enjoy.&nbsp; It is not to the
woman&rsquo;s dishonour, if she felt, before her husband, higher
aspirations than those after mere animal pleasure.&nbsp; To be as
gods, knowing good and evil, is a vain and foolish, but not a
base and brutal, wish.&nbsp; She proved herself
thereby&mdash;though at an awful cost&mdash;a woman, and not an
animal.&nbsp; And indeed the woman&rsquo;s more delicate
organisation, her more vivid emotions, her more voluble fancy, as
well as her mere physical weakness and weariness, have been to
her, in all ages, a special source of temptation; which it is to
her honour that she has resisted so much better than the
physically stronger, and therefore more culpable, man.</p>
<p>As for what the tree of knowledge was, there really is no need
for us to waste our time in guessing.&nbsp; If it was not one
plant, then it was another.&nbsp; It may have been something
which has long since perished off the earth.&nbsp; It may have
been&mdash;as some learned men have guessed&mdash;the sacred
Soma, or Homa, of the early Brahmin race; and that may have been
a still existing narcotic species of Asclepias.&nbsp; It
certainly was not the vine.&nbsp; The language of the Hebrew
Scripture concerning it, and the sacred use to which it is
consecrated in the Gospels, forbid that notion utterly; at least
to those who know enough of antiquity to pass by, with a smile,
the theory that the wines mentioned in Scripture were not
intoxicating.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;as a fresh corroboration of
what I am trying to say&mdash;how fearfully has that noble gift
to man been abused for the same end as a hundred other vegetable
products, ever since those mythic days when Dionusos brought the
vine from the far East, amid troops of human M&aelig;nads and
half-human Satyrs; and the Bacch&aelig; tore Pentheus in pieces
on Cith&aelig;ron, for daring to intrude upon their sacred rites;
and since those historic days, too, when, less than two hundred
years before the Christian era, the Bacchic rites spread from
Southern Italy into Etruria, and thence to the matrons of Rome;
and under the guidance of Poenia Annia, a Campanian lady, took at
last shapes of which no man must speak, but which had to be put
down with terrible but just severity, by the Consuls and the
Senate.</p>
<p>But it matters little, I say, what this same tree of knowledge
was.&nbsp; Was every vine on earth destroyed to-morrow, and every
vegetable also from which alcohol is now distilled, man would
soon discover something else wherewith to satisfy the insatiate
craving.&nbsp; Has he not done so already?&nbsp; Has not almost
every people had its tree of knowledge, often more deadly than
any distilled liquor, from the absinthe of the cultivated
Frenchman, and the opium of the cultivated Chinese, down to the
bush-poisons wherewith the tropic sorcerer initiates his dupes
into the knowledge of good and evil, and the fungus from which
the Samoiede extracts in autumn a few days of brutal happiness,
before the setting in of the long six months&rsquo; night?&nbsp;
God grant that modern science may not bring to light fresh
substitutes for alcohol, opium, and the rest; and give the white
races, in that state of effeminate and godless quasi-civilisation
which I sometimes fear is creeping upon them, fresh means of
destroying themselves delicately and pleasantly off the face of
the earth.</p>
<p>It is said by some that drunkenness is on the increase in this
island.&nbsp; I have no trusty proof of it: but I can believe it
possible; for every cause of drunkenness seems on the
increase.&nbsp; Overwork of body and mind; circumstances which
depress health; temptation to drink, and drink again, at every
corner of the streets; and finally, money, and ever more money,
in the hands of uneducated people, who have not the desire, and
too often not the means, of spending it in any save the lowest
pleasures.&nbsp; These, it seems to me, are the true causes of
drunkenness, increasing or not.&nbsp; And if we wish to become a
more temperate nation, we must lessen them, if we cannot
eradicate them.</p>
<p>First, overwork.&nbsp; We all live too fast, and work too
hard.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things are full of labour, man cannot
utter it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the heavy struggle for existence which
goes on all around us, each man is tasked more and more&mdash;if
he be really worth buying and using&mdash;to the utmost of his
powers all day long.&nbsp; The weak have to compete on equal
terms with the strong; and crave, in consequence, for artificial
strength.&nbsp; How we shall stop that I know not, while every
man is &ldquo;making haste to be rich, and piercing himself
through with many sorrows, and falling into foolish and hurtful
lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How we shall stop that, I say, I know not.&nbsp; The old prophet
may have been right when he said: &ldquo;Surely it is not of the
Lord that the people shall labour in the very fire, and weary
themselves for very vanity;&rdquo; and in some juster, wiser,
more sober system of society&mdash;somewhat more like the Kingdom
of The Father come on earth&mdash;it may be that poor human
beings will not need to toil so hard, and to keep themselves up
to their work by stimulants, but will have time to sit down, and
look around them, and think of God, and God&rsquo;s quiet
universe, with something of quiet in themselves; something of
rational leisure, and manful sobriety of mind, as well as of
body.</p>
<p>But it seems to me also, that in such a state of society,
when&mdash;as it was once well put&mdash;&ldquo;every one has
stopped running about like rats:&rdquo;&mdash;that those who work
hard, whether with muscle or with brain, would not be surrounded,
as now, with every circumstance which tempts toward drink; by
every circumstance which depresses the vital energies, and leaves
them an easy prey to pestilence itself; by bad light, bad air,
bad food, bad water, bad smells, bad occupations, which weaken
the muscles, cramp the chest, disorder the digestion.&nbsp; Let
any rational man, fresh from the country&mdash;in which I presume
God, having made it, meant all men, more or less, to
live&mdash;go through the back streets of any city, or through
whole districts of the &ldquo;black countries&rdquo; of England;
and then ask himself: Is it the will of God that His human
children should live and toil in such dens, such deserts, such
dark places of the earth?&nbsp; Lot him ask himself: Can they
live and toil there without contracting a probably diseased habit
of body; without contracting a certainly dull, weary, sordid
habit of mind, which craves for any pleasure, however brutal, to
escape from its own stupidity and emptiness?&nbsp; When I run
through, by rail, certain parts of the iron-producing
country&mdash;streets of furnaces, collieries, slag heaps, mud,
slop, brick house-rows, smoke, dirt&mdash;and that is all; and
when I am told, whether truly or falsely, that the main thing
which the well-paid and well-fed men of those abominable wastes
care for is&mdash;good fighting-dogs: I can only answer, that I
am not surprised.</p>
<p>I say&mdash;as I have said elsewhere, and shall do my best to
say it again&mdash;that the craving for drink and narcotics,
especially that engendered in our great cities, is not a disease,
but a symptom of disease; of a far deeper disease than any which
drunkenness can produce; namely, of the growing degeneracy of a
population striving in vain by stimulants and narcotics to fight
against those slow poisons with which our greedy barbarism,
miscalled civilisation, has surrounded them from the cradle to
the grave.&nbsp; I may be answered that the old German, Angle,
Dane, drank heavily.&nbsp; I know it: but why did they drink,
save for the same reason that the fenman drank, and his wife took
opium, at least till the fens were drained? why but to keep off
the depressing effects of the malaria of swamps and new
clearings, which told on them&mdash;who always settled in the
lowest grounds&mdash;in the shape of fever and ague?&nbsp; Here
it may be answered again that stimulants have been, during the
memory of man, the destruction of the Red Indian race in
America.&nbsp; I reply boldly that I do not believe it.&nbsp;
There is evidence enough in Jacques Cartier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Voyages to the Rivers of Canada;&rdquo; and evidence more
than enough in Strachey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Travaile in
Virginia&rdquo;&mdash;to quote only two authorities out of
many&mdash;to prove that the Red Indians, when the white man
first met with them, were, in North and South alike, a diseased,
decaying, and, as all their traditions confess, decreasing
race.&nbsp; Such a race would naturally crave for &ldquo;the
water of life,&rdquo; the &ldquo;usquebagh,&rdquo; or whisky, as
we have contracted the old name now.&nbsp; But I should have
thought that the white man, by introducing among these poor
creatures iron, fire-arms, blankets, and above all, horses
wherewith to follow the buffalo-herds, which they could never
follow on foot, must have done ten times more towards keeping
them alive, than he has done towards destroying them by giving
them the chance of a week&rsquo;s drunkenness twice a year, when
they came in to his forts to sell the skins which, without his
gifts, they would never have got.</p>
<p>Such a race would, of course, if wanting vitality, crave for
stimulants.&nbsp; But if the stimulants, and not the original
want of vitality, combined with morals utterly detestable, and
worthy only of the gallows&mdash;and here I know what I say, and
dare not tell what I know, from eye-witnesses&mdash;have been the
cause of the Red Indians&rsquo; extinction, then how is it, let
me ask, that the Irishman and the Scotsman have, often to their
great harm, been drinking as much whisky&mdash;and usually very
bad whisky&mdash;not merely twice a year, but as often as they
could get it, during the whole Iron Age, and, for aught anyone
can tell, during the Bronze Age, and the Stone Age before that,
and yet are still the most healthy, able, valiant, and prolific
races in Europe?&nbsp; Had they drunk less whisky they would,
doubtless, have been more healthy, able, valiant, and perhaps
even <i>more</i> prolific, than they are now.&nbsp; They show no
sign, however, as yet, of going the way of the Red Indian.</p>
<p>But if the craving for stimulants and narcotics is a token of
deficient vitality, then the deadliest foe of that craving, and
all its miserable results, is surely the Sanatory Reformer; the
man who preaches, and&mdash;as far as ignorance and vested
interests will allow him, procures&mdash;for the masses, pure
air, pure sunlight, pure water, pure dwelling-houses, pure
food.&nbsp; Not merely every fresh drinking-fountain, but every
fresh public bath and wash-house, every fresh open space, every
fresh growing tree, every fresh open window, every fresh flower
in that window&mdash;each of these is so much, as the old
Persians would have said, conquered for Ormuzd, the god of light
and life, out of the dominion of Ahriman, the king of darkness
and of death; so much taken from the causes of drunkenness and
disease, and added to the causes of sobriety and health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile one thing is clear: that if this present barbarism
and anarchy of covetousness, miscalled modern civilisation, were
tamed and drilled into something more like a Kingdom of God on
earth, then we should not see the reckless and needless
multiplication of liquor shops, which disgraces this country
now.</p>
<p>As a single instance: in one country parish of nine hundred
inhabitants, in which the population has increased only one-ninth
in the last fifty years, there are now practically eight
public-houses, where fifty years ago there were but two.&nbsp;
One, that is, for every hundred and ten&mdash;or rather, omitting
children, farmers, shop-keepers, gentlemen, and their households,
one for every fifty of the inhabitants.&nbsp; In the face of the
allurements, often of the basest kind, which these dens offer,
the clergyman and the schoolmaster struggle in vain to keep up
night schools and young men&rsquo;s clubs, and to inculcate
habits of providence.</p>
<p>The young labourers over a great part of the south and east,
at least of England&mdash;though never so well off, for several
generations, as they are now&mdash;are growing up thriftless,
shiftless; inferior, it seems to me, to their grandfathers in
everything, save that they can usually read and write, and their
grandfathers could not; and that they wear smart cheap cloth
clothes, instead of their grandfathers&rsquo; smock-frocks.</p>
<p>And if it be so in the country, how must it be in towns?&nbsp;
There must come a thorough change in the present licensing
system, in spite of all the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; which certain
powerful vested interests may bring to bear on governments.&nbsp;
And it is the duty of every good citizen, who cares for his
countrymen, and for their children after them, to help in
bringing about that change as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>Again: I said just now that a probable cause of increasing
drunkenness was the increasing material prosperity of thousands
who knew no recreation beyond low animal pleasure.&nbsp; If I am
right&mdash;and I believe that I am right&mdash;I must urge on
those who wish drunkenness to decrease, the necessity of
providing more, and more refined, recreation for the people.</p>
<p>Men drink, and women too, remember, not merely to supply
exhaustion, not merely to drive away care; but often simply to
drive away dulness.&nbsp; They have nothing to do save to think
over what they have done in the day, or what they expect to do
to-morrow; and they escape from that dreary round of business
thought in liquor or narcotics.&nbsp; There are still those, by
no means of the hand-working class, but absorbed all day by
business, who drink heavily at night in their own comfortable
homes, simply to recreate their over-burdened minds.&nbsp; Such
cases, doubtless, are far less common than they were fifty years
ago: but why?&nbsp; Is not the decrease of drinking among the
richer classes certainly due to the increased refinement and
variety of their tastes and occupations?&nbsp; In cultivating the
&aelig;sthetic side of man&rsquo;s nature; in engaging him with
the beautiful, the pure, the wonderful, the truly natural; with
painting, poetry, music, horticulture, physical science&mdash;in
all this lies recreation, in the true and literal sense of that
word, namely, the re-creating and mending of the exhausted mind
and feelings, such as no rational man will now neglect, either
for himself, his children, or his workpeople.</p>
<p>But how little of all this is open to the masses, all should
know but too well.&nbsp; How little opportunity the average
hand-worker, or his wife, has of eating of any tree of knowledge,
save of the very basest kind, is but too palpable.&nbsp; We are
mending, thank God, in this respect.&nbsp; Free libraries and
museums have sprung up of late in other cities beside
London.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s blessing rest upon them all.&nbsp; And
the Crystal Palace, and still later, the Bethnal Green Museum,
have been, I believe, of far more use than many average sermons
and lectures from many average orators.</p>
<p>But are we not still far behind the old Greeks, and the Romans
of the Empire likewise, in the amount of amusement and
instruction, and even of shelter, which we provide for the
people?&nbsp; Recollect the&mdash;to me&mdash;disgraceful fact,
that there is not, as far as I am aware, throughout the whole of
London, a single portico or other covered place, in which the
people can take refuge during a shower: and this in the climate
of England!&nbsp; Where they do take refuge on a wet day the
publican knows but too well; as he knows also where thousands of
the lower classes, simply for want of any other place to be in,
save their own sordid dwellings, spend as much as they are
permitted of the Sabbath day.&nbsp; Let us put down &ldquo;Sunday
drinking&rdquo; by all means, if we can.&nbsp; But let us
remember that by closing the public-houses on Sunday, we prevent
no man or woman from carrying home as much poison as they choose
on Saturday night, to brutalise themselves therewith, perhaps for
eight-and-forty hours.&nbsp; And let us see&mdash;in the name of
Him who said that He had made the Sabbath for man, and not man
for the Sabbath&mdash;let us see, I say, if we cannot do
something to prevent the townsman&rsquo;s Sabbath being, not a
day of rest, but a day of mere idleness; the day of most
temptation, because of most dulness, of the whole seven.</p>
<p>And here, perhaps some sweet soul may look up reprovingly and
say: &ldquo;He talks of rest.&nbsp; Does he forget, and would he
have the working man forget, that all these outward palliatives
will never touch the seat of the disease, the unrest of the soul
within?&nbsp; Does he forget, and would he have the working man
forget, who it was who said&mdash;who only has the right to say:
&ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye who are weary and heavy laden, and I
will give you rest&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah no, sweet soul.&nbsp; I
know your words are true.&nbsp; I know that what we all want is
inward rest; rest of heart and brain; the calm, strong,
self-contained, self-denying character; which needs no
stimulants, for it has no fits of depression; which needs no
narcotics, for it has no fits of excitement; which needs no
ascetic restraints, for it is strong enough to use God&rsquo;s
gifts without abusing them; the character, in a word, which is
truly temperate, not in drink or food merely, but in all desires,
thoughts, and actions; freed from the wild lusts and ambitions to
which that old Adam yielded, and, seeking for light and life by
means forbidden, found thereby disease and death.&nbsp; Yes, I
know that; and know, too, that that rest is found only where you
have already found it.</p>
<p>And yet, in such a world as this, governed by a Being who has
made sunshine, and flowers, and green grass, and the song of
birds, and happy human smiles, and who would educate by
them&mdash;if we would let Him&mdash;His human children from the
cradle to the grave; in such a world as this, will you grudge any
particle of that education, even any harmless substitute for it,
to those spirits in prison whose surroundings too often tempt
them, from the cradle to the grave, to fancy that the world is
composed of bricks and iron, and governed by inspectors and
policemen?&nbsp; Preach to those spirits in prison, as you know
far better than we parsons how to preach; but let them have
besides some glimpses of the splendid fact, that outside their
prison-house is a world which God, not man, has made; wherein
grows everywhere that tree of knowledge, which is likewise the
tree of life; and that they have a right to some small share of
its beauty, and its wonder, and its rest, for their own health of
soul and body, and for the health of their children after
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pleasure, gentlemen and ladies,
of addressing you here is mixed in my mind with very solemn
feelings; the honour which you have done me is tempered by
humiliating thoughts.</p>
<p>For it was in this very city of Bristol, twenty-seven years
ago, that I received my first lesson in what is now called Social
Science; and yet, alas! more than ten years elapsed ere I could
even spell out that lesson, though it had been written for me (as
well as for all England) in letters of flame, from the one end of
heaven to the other.</p>
<p>I was a school-boy in Clifton up above.&nbsp; I had been
hearing of political disturbances, even of riots, of which I
understood nothing, and for which I cared nothing.&nbsp; But on
one memorable Sunday afternoon I saw an object which was
distinctly not political.&nbsp; Otherwise I should have no right
to speak of it here.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon of sullen autumn rain.&nbsp; The fog hung
thick over the docks and lowlands.&nbsp; Glaring through that fog
I saw a bright mass of flame&mdash;almost like a half-risen
sun.</p>
<p>That, I was told, was the gate of the new gaol on fire.&nbsp;
That the prisoners in it had been set free; that&mdash;But why
speak of what too many here recollect but too well?&nbsp; The fog
rolled slowly upward.&nbsp; Dark figures, even at that great
distance, were flitting to and fro across what seemed the mouth
of the pit.&nbsp; The flame increased&mdash;multiplied&mdash;at
one point after another; till by ten o&rsquo;clock that night I
seemed to be looking down upon Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, and to hear
the multitudinous moan and wail of the lost spirits surging to
and fro amid that sea of fire.</p>
<p>Right behind Brandon Hill&mdash;how can I ever forget
it?&mdash;rose the great central mass of fire; till the little
mound seemed converted into a volcano, from the peak of which the
flame streamed up, not red alone, but, delicately green and blue,
pale rose and pearly white, while crimson sparks leapt and fell
again in the midst of that rainbow, not of hope, but of despair;
and dull explosions down below mingled with the roar of the mob,
and the infernal hiss and crackle of the flame.</p>
<p>Higher and higher the fog was scorched and shrivelled upward
by the fierce heat below, glowing through and through with red
reflected glare, till it arched itself into one vast dome of
red-hot iron, fit roof for all the madness down below&mdash;and
beneath it, miles away, I could see the lonely tower of Dundie
shining red;&mdash;the symbol of the old faith, looking down in
stately wonder and sorrow upon the fearful birth-throes of a new
age.&nbsp; Yes.&mdash;Why did I say just now despair?&nbsp; I was
wrong.&nbsp; Birth-throes, and not death pangs, those horrors
were.&nbsp; Else they would have no place in my discourse; no
place, indeed, in my mind.&nbsp; Why talk over the signs of
disease, decay, death?&nbsp; Let the dead bury their dead, and
let us follow Him who dieth not; by whose command</p>
<blockquote><p>The old order changeth, giving place to the
new,<br />
And God fulfils himself in many ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we will believe this,&mdash;if we will look on each
convulsion of society, however terrible for the time being, as a
token, not of decrepitude, but of youth; not as the expiring
convulsions of sinking humanity, but as upward struggles, upward
toward fuller light, freer air, a juster, simpler, and more
active life;&mdash;then we shall be able to look calmly, however
sadly, on the most appalling tragedies of humanity&mdash;even on
these late Indian ones&mdash;and take our share, faithful and
hopeful, in supplying the new and deeper wants of a new and
nobler time.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; It was on the Tuesday or Wednesday after,
if I recollect right, that I saw another, and a still more awful
sight.&nbsp; Along the north side of Queen Square, in front of
ruins which had been three days before noble buildings, lay a
ghastly row, not of corpses, but of corpse-fragments.&nbsp; I
have no more wish than you to dilate upon that sight.&nbsp; But
there was one charred fragment&mdash;with a scrap of old red
petticoat adhering to it, which I never forgot&mdash;which I
trust in God that I never shall forget.&nbsp; It is good for a
man to be brought once at least in his life face to face with
fact, ultimate fact, however horrible it may be; and have to
confess to himself, shuddering, what things are possible upon
God&rsquo;s earth, when man has forgotten that his only welfare
lies in living after the likeness of God.</p>
<p>Not that I learnt the lesson then.&nbsp; When the first
excitement of horror and wonder were past, what I had seen made
me for years the veriest aristocrat, full of hatred and contempt
of these dangerous classes, whose existence I had for the first
time discovered.&nbsp; It required many years&mdash;years, too,
of personal intercourse with the poor&mdash;to explain to me the
true meaning of what I saw here in October twenty-seven years
ago, and to learn a part of that lesson which God taught to
others thereby.&nbsp; And one part at least of that lesson was
this: That the social state of a city depends directly on its
moral state, and&mdash;I fear dissenting voices, but I must say
what I believe to be truth&mdash;that the moral state of a city
depends&mdash;how far I know not, but frightfully, to an extent
as yet uncalculated, and perhaps incalculable&mdash;on the
physical state of that city; on the food, water, air, and lodging
of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>But that lesson, and others connected with it, was learnt, and
learnt well, by hundreds.&nbsp; From the sad catastrophe I date
the rise of that interest in Social Science; that desire for some
nobler, more methodic, more permanent benevolence than that which
stops at mere almsgiving and charity-schools.&nbsp; The dangerous
classes began to be recognised as an awful fact which must be
faced; and faced, not by repression, but by improvement.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Perils of the Nation&rdquo; began to occupy the
attention not merely of politicians, but of philosophers,
physicians, priests; and the admirable book which assumed that
title did but re-echo the feeling of thousands of earnest
hearts.</p>
<p>Ever since that time, scheme on scheme of improvement has been
not only proposed but carried out.&nbsp; A general interest of
the upper classes in the lower, a general desire to do good, and
to learn how good can be done, has been awakened throughout
England, such as, I boldly say, never before existed in any
country upon earth; and England, her eyes opened to her neglect
of these classes, without whose strong arms her wealth and genius
would be useless, has put herself into a permanent state of
confession of sin, repentance, and amendment, which I verily
trust will be accepted by Almighty God; and will, in spite of our
present shame and sorrow, <a name="citation192"></a><a
href="#footnote192" class="citation">[192]</a> in spite of shame
and sorrow which may be yet in store for us, save alive both the
soul and the body of this ancient people.</p>
<p>Let us then, that we may learn how to bear our part in this
great work of Social Reform, consider awhile great cities, their
good and evil; and let us start from the facts about your own
city of which I have just put you in remembrance.&nbsp; The
universal law will be best understood from the particular
instance; and best of all, from the instance with which you are
most intimately acquainted.&nbsp; And do not, I entreat you, fear
that I shall be rude enough to say anything which may give pain
to you, my generous hosts; or presumptuous enough to impute blame
to anyone for events which happened long ago, and of the exciting
causes of which I know little or nothing.&nbsp; Bristol was then
merely in the same state in which other cities of England were,
and in which every city on the Continent is now; and the local
exciting causes of that outbreak, the personal conduct of A or B
in it, is just what we ought most carefully to forget, if we wish
to look at the real root of the matter.&nbsp; If consumption,
latent in the constitution, have broken out in active mischief,
the wise physician will trouble his head little with the
particular accident which woke up the sleeping disease.&nbsp; The
disease was there, and if one thing had not awakened it some
other would.&nbsp; And so, if the population of a great city have
got into a socially diseased state, it matters little what shock
may have caused it to explode.&nbsp; Politics may in one case,
fanaticism in another, national hatred in a third, hunger in a
fourth&mdash;perhaps even, as in Byzantium of old, no more
important matter than the jealousy between the blue and the green
charioteers in the theatre, may inflame a whole population to
madness and civil war.&nbsp; Our business is not with the nature
of the igniting spark, but of the powder which is ignited.</p>
<p>I will not, then, to begin, go as far as some who say that
&ldquo;A great city is a great evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot say
that Bristol was in 1830 or is now, a great evil.&nbsp; It
represents so much realised wealth; and that, again, so much
employment for thousands.&nbsp; It represents so much commerce;
so much knowledge of foreign lands; so much distribution of their
products; so much science, employed about that distribution.</p>
<p>And it is undeniable, that as yet we have had no means of
rapid and cheap distribution of goods, whether imports or
manufactures, save by this crowding of human beings into great
cities, for the more easy despatch of business.&nbsp; Whether we
shall devise other means hereafter is a question of which I shall
speak presently.&nbsp; Meanwhile, no man is to be blamed for the
existence, hardly even for the evils, of great cities.&nbsp; The
process of their growth has been very simple.&nbsp; They have
gathered themselves round abbeys and castles, for the sake of
protection; round courts, for the sake of law; round ports, for
the sake of commerce; round coal mines, for the sake of
manufacture.&nbsp; Before the existence of railroads,
penny-posts, electric telegraphs, men were compelled to be as
close as possible to each other, in order to work together.</p>
<p>When the population was small, and commerce feeble, the cities
grew to no very great size, and the bad effects of this crowding
were not felt.&nbsp; The cities of England in the Middle Age were
too small to keep their inhabitants week after week, month after
month, in one deadly vapour-bath of foul gas; and though the
mortality among infants was probably excessive, yet we should
have seen among the adult survivors few or none of those stunted
and etiolated figures so common now in England, as well as on the
Continent.&nbsp; The green fields were close outside the walls,
where lads and lasses went a-maying, and children gathered
flowers, and sober burghers with their wives took the evening
walk; there were the butts, too, close outside, where stalwart
prentice-lads ran and wrestled, and pitched the bar, and played
backsword, and practised with the long-bow; and sometimes, in
stormy times, turned out for a few months as ready-trained
soldiers, and, like Ulysses of old,</p>
<blockquote><p>Drank delight of battle with their peers,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then returned again to the workshop and the loom.&nbsp;
The very mayor and alderman went forth, at five o&rsquo;clock on
the summer&rsquo;s morning, with hawk and leaping-pole, after a
duck and heron; or hunted the hare in state, probably in the full
glory of furred gown and gold chain; and then returned to
breakfast, and doubtless transacted their day&rsquo;s business
all the better for their morning&rsquo;s gallop on the breezy
downs.</p>
<p>But there was another side to this genial and healthy
picture.&nbsp; A hint that this was a state of society which had
its conditions, its limit; and if those were infringed, woe alike
to burgher and to prentice.&nbsp; Every now and then epidemic
disease entered the jolly city&mdash;and then down went strong
and weak, rich and poor, before the invisible and seemingly
supernatural arrows of that angel of death whom they had been
pampering unwittingly in every bedroom.</p>
<p>They fasted, they prayed; but in vain.&nbsp; They called the
pestilence a judgment of God; and they called it by a true
name.&nbsp; But they know not (and who are we to blame them for
not knowing?) what it was that God was judging thereby&mdash;foul
air, foul water, unclean backyards, stifling attics, houses
hanging over the narrow street till light and air were alike shut
out&mdash;that there lay the sin; and that to amend that was the
repentance which God demanded.</p>
<p>Yet we cannot blame them.&nbsp; They showed that the crowded
city life can bring out human nobleness as well as human
baseness; that to be crushed into contact with their fellow-men,
forced at least the loftier and tender souls to know their
fellow-men, and therefore to care for them, to love them, to die
for them.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;from one temptation the city life is
free, to which the country life is sadly exposed&mdash;that
isolation which, self-contented and self-helping, forgets in its
surly independence that man is his brother&rsquo;s keeper.&nbsp;
In cities, on the contrary, we find that the stories of these old
pestilences, when the first panic terror has past, become,
however tragical, still beautiful and heroic; and we read of
noble-hearted men and women palliating ruin which they could not
cure, braving dangers which seemed to them miraculous, from which
they were utterly defenceless, spending money, time, and, after
all, life itself upon sufferers from whom they might without
shame have fled.</p>
<p>They are very cheering, the stories of the old city
pestilences; and the nobleness which they brought out in the
heart of many a townsman who had seemed absorbed in the lust of
gain&mdash;who perhaps had been really absorbed in it&mdash;till
that fearful hour awakened in him his better self, and taught
him, not self-aggrandisement, but self-sacrifice; begetting in
him, out of the very depth of darkness, new and divine
light.&nbsp; That nobleness, doubt it not, exists as ever in the
hearts of citizens.&nbsp; May God grant us to see the day when it
shall awaken to exert itself, not for the palliation, not even
for the cure, but for the prevention, yea, the utter
extermination, of pestilence.</p>
<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century, as far as I can
ascertain, another and even more painful phenomenon appears in
our great cities&mdash;a dangerous class.&nbsp; How it arose is
not yet clear.&nbsp; That the Reformation had something to do
with the matter, we can hardly doubt.&nbsp; At the dissolution of
the monasteries, the more idle, ignorant, and profligate members
of the mendicant orders, unable to live any longer on the alms of
the public, sunk, probably, into vicious penury.&nbsp; The
frightful misgovernment of this country during the minority of
Edward the Sixth, especially the conversion of tilled lands into
pasture, had probably the effect of driving the surplus
agricultural population into the great towns.&nbsp; But the
social history of this whole period is as yet obscure, and I have
no right to give an opinion on it.&nbsp; Another element, and a
more potent one, is to be found in the discharged soldiers who
came home from foreign war, and the sailors who returned from our
voyages of discovery, and from our raids against the Spaniards,
too often crippled by scurvy, or by Tropic fevers, with perhaps a
little prize money, which was as hastily spent as it had been
hastily gained.&nbsp; The later years of Elizabeth, and the whole
of James the First&rsquo;s reign, disclose to us an ugly state of
society in the low streets of all our sea-port towns; and
Bristol, as one of the great starting-points of West Indian
adventure, was probably, during the seventeenth century, as bad
as any city in England.&nbsp; According to Ben Jonson, and the
playwriters of his time, the beggars become a regular
fourth-estate, with their own laws, and even their own
language&mdash;of which we may remark, that the thieves&rsquo;
Latin of those days is full of German words, indicating that its
inventors had been employed in the Continental wars of the
time.&nbsp; How that class sprung up, we may see, I suppose,
pretty plainly, from Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Henry the
Fifth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether Nym, Pistol, and Bardolph, Doll and
Mrs. Quickly, existed in the reign of Henry the Fifth, they
certainly existed in the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; They are
probably sketches from life of people whom Shakespeare had seen
in Alsatia and the Mint.</p>
<p>To these merely rascal elements, male and female, we must add,
I fear, those whom mere penury, from sickness, failure, want of
employment drove into dwellings of the lowest order.&nbsp; Such
people, though not criminal themselves, are but too likely to
become the parents of criminals.&nbsp; I am not blaming them,
poor souls; God forbid!&nbsp; I am merely stating a fact.&nbsp;
When we examine into the ultimate cause of a dangerous class;
into the one property common to all its members, whether thieves,
beggars, profligates, or the merely pauperised&mdash;we find it
to be this loss of self-respect.&nbsp; As long as that remains,
poor souls may struggle on heroically, pure amid penury, filth,
degradation unspeakable.&nbsp; But when self-respect is lost,
they are lost with it.&nbsp; And whatever may be the fate of
virtuous parents, children brought up in dens of physical and
moral filth cannot retrieve self-respect.&nbsp; They sink, they
must sink, into a life on a level with the sights, sounds, aye,
the very smells, which surround them.&nbsp; It is not merely that
the child&rsquo;s mind is contaminated, by seeing and hearing, in
overcrowded houses, what he should not hear and see: but the
whole physical circumstances of his life are destructive of
self-respect.&nbsp; He has no means for washing himself properly:
but he has enough of the innate sense of beauty and fitness to
feel that he ought not to be dirty; he thinks that others despise
him for being dirty, and he half despises himself for being
so.&nbsp; In all raged schools and reformatories, so they tell
me, the first step toward restoring self-respect is to make the
poor fellows clean.&nbsp; From that moment they begin to look on
themselves as new men&mdash;with a new start, new hopes, new
duties.&nbsp; For not without the deepest physical as well as
moral meaning, was baptism chosen by the old Easterns, and
adopted by our Lord Jesus Christ, as the sign of a new life; and
outward purity made the token and symbol of that inward purity
which is the parent of self-respect, and manliness, and a clear
conscience; of the free forehead, and the eye which meets boldly
and honestly the eye of its fellow-man.</p>
<p>But would that mere physical dirt were all that the lad has to
contend with.&nbsp; There is the desire of enjoyment.&nbsp; Moral
and intellectual enjoyment he has none, and can have none: but
not to enjoy something is to be dead in life; and to the lowest
physical pleasures he will betake himself, and all the more
fiercely because his opportunities of enjoyment are so
limited.&nbsp; It is a hideous subject; I will pass it by very
shortly; only asking of you, as I have to ask daily of
myself&mdash;this solemn question: We, who have so many comforts,
so many pleasures of body, soul, and spirit, from the lowest
appetite to the highest aspiration, that we can gratify each in
turn with due and wholesome moderation, innocently and
innocuously&mdash;who are we that we should judge the poor
untaught and overtempted inhabitant of Temple Street and
Lewin&rsquo;s Mead, if, having but one or two pleasures possible
to him, he snatches greedily, even foully, at the little which he
has?</p>
<p>And this brings me to another, and a most fearful evil of
great cities, namely, drunkenness.&nbsp; I am one of those who
cannot, on scientific grounds, consider drunkenness as a cause of
evil, but as an effect.&nbsp; Of course it is a cause&mdash;a
cause of endless crime and misery; but I am convinced that to
cure, you must inquire, not what it causes, but what causes
it?&nbsp; And for that we shall not have to seek far.</p>
<p>The main exciting cause of drunkenness is, I believe, firmly,
bad air and bad lodging.</p>
<p>A man shall spend his days between a foul alley where he
breathes sulphuretted hydrogen, a close workshop where he
breathes carbonic acid, and a close and foul bedroom where he
breathes both.&nbsp; In neither of the three places, meanwhile,
has he his fair share of that mysterious chemical agent without
which health is impossible, the want of which betrays itself at
once in the dull eye, the sallow cheek&mdash;namely, light.&nbsp;
Believe me, it is no mere poetic metaphor which connects in
Scripture, Light with Life.&nbsp; It is the expression of a deep
law, one which holds as true in the physical as in the spiritual
world; a case in which (as perhaps in all cases) the laws of the
visible world are the counterparts of those of the invisible
world, and Earth is the symbol of Heaven.</p>
<p>Deprive, then, the man of his fair share of fresh air and pure
light, and what follows?&nbsp; His blood is not properly
oxygenated: his nervous energy is depressed, his digestion
impaired, especially if his occupation be sedentary, or requires
much stooping, and the cavity of the chest thereby becomes
contracted; and for that miserable feeling of languor and craving
he knows but one remedy&mdash;the passing stimulus of
alcohol;&mdash;a passing stimulus; leaving fresh depression
behind it, and requiring fresh doses of stimulant, till it
becomes a habit, a slavery, a madness.&nbsp; Again, there is an
intellectual side to the question.&nbsp; The depressed nervous
energy, the impaired digestion, depress the spirits.&nbsp; The
man feels low in mind as well as in body.&nbsp; Whence shall he
seek exhilaration?&nbsp; Not in that stifling home which has
caused the depression itself.&nbsp; He knows none other than the
tavern, and the company which the tavern brings; God help
him!</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is easy to say, God help him;
but it is not difficult for man to help him also.&nbsp;
Drunkenness is a very curable malady.&nbsp; The last fifty years
has seen it all but die out among the upper classes of this
country.&nbsp; And what has caused the improvement?</p>
<p>Certainly, in the first place, the spread of education.&nbsp;
Every man has now a hundred means of rational occupation and
amusement which were closed to his grandfather; and among the
deadliest enemies of drunkenness, we may class the
printing-press, the railroad, and the importation of foreign art
and foreign science, which we owe to the late forty years&rsquo;
peace.&nbsp; We can find plenty of amusement now, beside the old
one of sitting round the table and talking over wine.&nbsp; Why
should not the poor man share in our gain?&nbsp; But over and
above, there are causes simply physical.&nbsp; Our houses are
better ventilated.&nbsp; The stifling old four-post bed has given
place to the airy curtainless one; and what is more than
all&mdash;we wash.&nbsp; That morning cold bath which foreigners
consider as Young England&rsquo;s strangest superstition, has
done as much, believe me, to abolish drunkenness, as any other
cause whatsoever.&nbsp; With a clean skin in healthy action, and
nerves and muscles braced by a sudden shock, men do not crave for
artificial stimulants.&nbsp; I have found that, coeteris paribus,
a man&rsquo;s sobriety is in direct proportion to his
cleanliness.&nbsp; I believe it would be so in all classes had
they the means.</p>
<p>And they ought to have the means.&nbsp; Whatever other rights
a man has, or ought to have, this at least he has, if society
demands of him that he should earn his own livelihood, and not be
a torment and a burden to his neighbours.&nbsp; He has a right to
water, to air, to light.&nbsp; In demanding that, he demands no
more than nature has given to the wild beast of the forest.&nbsp;
He is better than they.&nbsp; Treat him, then, as well as God has
treated them.&nbsp; If we require of him to be a man, we must at
least put him on a level with the brutes.</p>
<p>We have then, first of all, to face the existence of a
dangerous class of this kind, into which the weaker as well as
the worst members of society have a continual tendency to
sink.&nbsp; A class which, not respecting itself, does not
respect others; which has nothing to lose and all to gain by
anarchy; in which the lowest passions, seldom gratified, are
ready to burst out and avenge themselves by frightful
methods.</p>
<p>For the reformation of that class, thousands of good men are
now working; hundreds of benevolent plans are being set on
foot.&nbsp; Honour to them all; whether they succeed or fail,
each of them does some good; each of them rescues at least a few
fellow-men, dear to God as you and I are, out of the nether
pit.&nbsp; Honour to them all, I say; but I should not be honest
with you this night, if I did not assert most solemnly my
conviction, that reformatories, ragged schools, even hospitals
and asylums, treat only the symptoms, not the actual causes, of
the disease; and that the causes are only to be touched by
improving the simple physical conditions of the class; by
abolishing foul air, foul water, foul lodging, overcrowded
dwellings, in which morality is difficult and common decency
impossible.&nbsp; You may breed a pig in a sty, ladies and
gentlemen, and make a learned pig of him after all; but you
cannot breed a man in a sty, and make a learned man of him; or
indeed, in the true sense of that great word, a man at all.</p>
<p>And remember, that these physical influences of great cities,
physically depressing and morally degrading, influence, though to
a less extent, the classes above the lowest stratum.</p>
<p>The honest and skilled workman feels their effects.&nbsp;
Compelled too often to live where he can, in order to be near his
work, he finds himself perpetually in contact with a class
utterly inferior to himself, and his children exposed to
contaminating influences from which he would gladly remove them;
but how can he?&nbsp; Next door to him, even in the same house
with him, may be enacted scenes of brutality or villainy which I
will not speak of here.&nbsp; He may shut his own eyes and ears
to them; but he cannot shut his children&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He may
vex his righteous soul daily, like Lot of old, with the foul
conversation of the wicked; but, like Lot of old, he cannot keep
his children from mixing with the inhabitants of the wicked city,
learning their works, and at last being involved in their
doom.&nbsp; Oh, ladies and gentlemen, if there be one class for
whom above all others I will plead, in season and out of season;
if there be one social evil which I will din into the ears of my
countrymen whenever God gives me a chance, it is this: The honest
and the virtuous workman, and his unnatural contact with the
dishonest and the foul.&nbsp; I know well the nobleness which
exists in the average of that class, in men and in
wives&mdash;their stern uncomplaining, valorous self-denial; and
nothing more stirs my pity than to see them struggling to bring
up a family in a moral and physical atmosphere where right
education is impossible.&nbsp; We lavish sympathy enough upon the
criminal; for God&rsquo;s sake let us keep a little of it for the
honest man.&nbsp; We spend thousands in carrying out the
separation of classes in prison; for God&rsquo;s sake let us try
to separate them a little before they go to prison.&nbsp; We are
afraid of the dangerous classes; for God&rsquo;s sake let us
bestir ourselves to stop that reckless confusion and neglect
which reign in the alleys and courts of our great towns, and
which recruit those very dangerous classes from the class which
ought to be, and is still, in spite of our folly, England&rsquo;s
strength and England&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Let us no longer stand
by idle, and see moral purity, in street after street, pent in
the same noisome den with moral corruption, to be involved in one
common doom, as the Latin tyrant of old used to bind together the
dead corpse and the living victim.&nbsp; But let the man who
would deserve well of his city, well of his country, set his
heart and brain to the great purpose of giving the workmen
dwellings fit for a virtuous and a civilised being, and like the
priest of old, stand between the living and the dead, that the
plague may be stayed.</p>
<p>Hardly less is the present physical state of our great cities
felt by that numerous class which is, next to the employer, the
most important in a city.&nbsp; I mean the shopmen, clerks, and
all the men, principally young ones, who are employed exclusively
in the work of distribution.&nbsp; I have a great respect, I may
say affection, for this class.&nbsp; In Bristol I know nothing of
them; save that, from what I hear, the clerks ought in general to
have a better status here than in most cities.&nbsp; I am told
that it is the practice here for merchants to take into their
houses very young boys, and train them to their business; that
this connection between employer and employed is hereditary, and
that clerkships pass from father to son in the same family.&nbsp;
I rejoice to hear it.&nbsp; It is pleasant to find anywhere a
relic of the old patriarchal bond, the permanent nexus between
master and man, which formed so important and so healthful an
element of the ancient mercantile system.&nbsp; One would gladly
overlook a little favouritism and nepotism, a little sticking
square men into round holes, and of round men into square holes,
for the sake of having a class of young clerks and
employ&eacute;s who felt that their master&rsquo;s business was
their business, his honour theirs, his prosperity theirs.</p>
<p>But over and above this, whenever I have come in contact with
this clerk and shopman class, they have impressed me with
considerable respect, not merely as to what they may be
hereafter, but what they are now.</p>
<p>They are the class from which the ranks of our commercial men,
our emigrants, are continually recruited; therefore their right
education is a matter of national importance.</p>
<p>The lad who stands behind a Bristol counter may be,
five-and-twenty years hence, a large employer&mdash;an owner of
houses and land in far countries across the seas&mdash;a member
of some colonial parliament&mdash;the founder of a wealthy
family.&nbsp; How necessary for the honour of Britain, for the
welfare of generations yet unborn, that that young man should
have, in body, soul, and spirit, the loftiest, and yet the most
practical of educations.</p>
<p>His education, too, such as it is, is one which makes me
respect him as one of a class.&nbsp; Of course, he is sometimes
one of those &ldquo;gents&rdquo; whom Punch so ruthlessly holds
up to just ridicule.&nbsp; He is sometimes a vulgar fop,
sometimes fond of low profligacy&mdash;of betting-houses and
casinos.&nbsp; Well&mdash;I know no class in any age or country
among which a fool may not be found here and there.&nbsp; But
that the &ldquo;gent&rdquo; is the average type of this class, I
should utterly deny from such experience as I have had.&nbsp; The
peculiar note and mark of the average clerk and shopman, is, I
think, in these days, intellectual activity, a keen desire for
self-improvement and for independence, honourable, because
self-acquired.&nbsp; But as he is distinctly a creature of the
city; as all city influences bear at once on him more than on any
other class, so we see in him, I think, more than in any class,
the best and the worst effects of modern city life.&nbsp; The
worst, of course, is low profligacy; but of that I do not speak
here.&nbsp; I mean that in the same man the good and evil of a
city life meet.&nbsp; And in this way.</p>
<p>In a countryman like me, coming up out of wild and silent
moorlands into a great city, the first effect of the change is
increased intellectual activity.&nbsp; The perpetual stream of
human faces, the innumerable objects of interest in every
shop-window, are enough to excite the mind to action, which is
increased by the simple fact of speaking to fifty different human
beings in the day instead of five.&nbsp; Now in the city-bred
youth this excited state of mind is chronic, permanent.&nbsp; It
is denoted plainly enough by the difference between the
countryman&rsquo;s face and that of the townsman.&nbsp; The
former in its best type (and it is often very noble) composed,
silent, self-contained, often stately, often listless; the latter
mobile, eager, observant, often brilliant, often
self-conscious.</p>
<p>Now if you keep this rapid and tense mind in a powerful and
healthy body, it would do right good work.&nbsp; Right good work
it does, indeed, as it is; but still it might do better.</p>
<p>For what are the faults of this class?&nbsp; What do the
obscurantists (now, thank God, fewer every day) allege as the
objection to allowing young men to educate themselves out of
working hours?</p>
<p>They become, it is said, discontented, conceited,
dogmatical.&nbsp; They take up hasty notions, they condemn
fiercely what they have no means of understanding; they are too
fond of fine words, of the excitement of spouting themselves, and
hearing others spout.</p>
<p>Well.&nbsp; I suppose there must be a little truth in the
accusation, or it would not have been invented.&nbsp; There is no
smoke without fire; and these certainly are the faults of which
the cleverest middle-class young men whom I know are most in
danger.</p>
<p>But&mdash;one fair look at these men&rsquo;s faces ought to
tell common sense that the cause is rather physical than
moral.&nbsp; Confined to sedentary occupations, stooping over
desks and counters in close rooms, unable to obtain that fair
share of bodily exercise which nature demands, and in continual
mental effort, their nerves and brain have been excited at the
expense of their lungs, their digestion, and their whole
nutritive system.&nbsp; Their complexions show a general
ill-health.&nbsp; Their mouths, too often, hint at latent
disease.&nbsp; What wonder if there be an irritability of brain
and nerve?&nbsp; I blame them no more for it than I blame a man
for being somewhat touchy while he is writhing in the gout.&nbsp;
Indeed less; for gout is very often a man&rsquo;s own fault; but
these men&rsquo;s ill-health is not.&nbsp; And, therefore,
everything which can restore to them health of body, will
preserve in them health of mind.&nbsp; Everything which ministers
to the <i>corpus sanum</i>, will minister also to the <i>mentem
sanam</i>; and a walk on Durham Downs, a game of cricket, a
steamer excursion to Chepstow, shall send them home again happier
and wiser men than poring over many wise volumes or hearing many
wise lectures.&nbsp; How often is a worthy fellow spending his
leisure honourably in hard reading, when he had much better have
been scrambling over hedge and ditch, without a thought in his
head save what was put there by the grass and the butterflies,
and the green trees and the blue sky?&nbsp; And therefore I do
press earnestly, both on employers and employed, the incalculable
value of athletic sports and country walks for those whose
business compels them to pass the day in the heart of the city; I
press on you, with my whole soul, the excellency of the
early-closing movement; not so much because it enables young men
to attend mechanics&rsquo; institutes, as because it enables
them, if they choose, to get a good game of leap-frog.&nbsp; You
may smile; but try the experiment, and see how, as the chest
expands, the muscles harden, and the cheek grows ruddy and the
lips firm, and sound sleep refreshes the lad for his next
day&rsquo;s work, the temper will become more patient, the
spirits more genial; there will be less tendency to brood angrily
over the inequalities of fortune, and to accuse society for evils
which as yet she knows not how to cure.</p>
<p>There is a class, again, above all these, which is doubtless
the most important of all; and yet of which I can say little
here&mdash;the capitalist, small and great, from the shopkeeper
to the merchant prince.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid that I should speak of them with aught but
respect.&nbsp; There are few figures, indeed, in the world on
which I look with higher satisfaction than on the British
merchant; the man whose ships are on a hundred seas; who sends
comfort and prosperity to tribes whom he never saw, and
honourably enriches himself by enriching others.&nbsp; There is
something to me chivalrous, even kingly, in the merchant life;
and there were men in Bristol of old&mdash;as I doubt not there
are now&mdash;who nobly fulfilled that ideal.&nbsp; I cannot
forget that Bristol was the nurse of America; that more than two
hundred years ago, the daring and genius of Bristol converted
yonder narrow stream into a mighty artery, down which flowed the
young life-blood of that great Transatlantic nation destined to
be hereafter, I believe, the greatest which the world ever
saw.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;were I asked to sum up in one sentence the
good of great cities, I would point first to Bristol, and then to
the United States, and say, That is what great cities can
do.&nbsp; By concentrating in one place, and upon one object,
men, genius, information, and wealth, they can conquer new-found
lands by arts instead of arms; they can beget new nations; and
replenish and subdue the earth from pole to pole.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is one fact about employers, in all cities
which I know, which may seem commonplace to you, but which to me
is very significant.&nbsp; Whatsoever business they may do in the
city, they take good care, if possible, not to live in it.&nbsp;
As soon as a man gets wealthy nowadays, his first act is to take
to himself a villa in the country.&nbsp; Do I blame him?&nbsp;
Certainly not.&nbsp; It is an act of common sense.&nbsp; He finds
that the harder he works, the more he needs of fresh air, free
country life, innocent recreation; and he takes it, and does his
city business all the better for it, lives all the longer for it,
is the cheerfuller, more genial man for it.&nbsp; One great
social blessing, I think, which railroads have brought, is the
throwing open country life to men of business.&nbsp; I say
blessing; both to the men themselves and to the country where
they settle.&nbsp; The citizen takes an honest pride in rivalling
the old country gentleman, in beating him in his own sphere, as
gardener, agriculturist, sportsman, head of the village; and by
his superior business habits and his command of ready money, he
very often does so.&nbsp; For fifty miles round London, wherever
I see progress&mdash;improved farms, model cottages, new
churches, new schools&mdash;I find, in three cases out of four,
that the author is some citizen who fifty years ago would have
known nothing but the narrow city life, and have had probably no
higher pleasures than those of the table; whose dreams would have
been, not as now, of model farms and schools, but of turtle and
port-wine.</p>
<p>My only regret when I see so pleasant a sight is: Oh that the
good man could have taken his workmen with him!</p>
<p>Taken his workmen with him?</p>
<p>I assure you that, after years of thought, I see no other
remedy for the worst evils of city life.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
says the old proverb, &ldquo;the mountain will not come to
Muhammed, then Muhammed must go to the mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
if you cannot bring the country into the city, the city must go
into the country.</p>
<p>Do not fancy me a dreamer dealing with impossible
ideals.&nbsp; I know well what cannot be done; fair and grand as
it would be, if it were done, a model city is impossible in
England.&nbsp; We have here no Eastern despotism (and it is well
we have not) to destroy an old Babylon, as that mighty genius
Nabuchonosor did, and build a few miles off a new Babylon,
one-half the area of which was park and garden, fountain and
water-course&mdash;a diviner work of art, to my mind, than the
finest picture or statue which the world ever saw.&nbsp; We have
not either (and it is well for us that we have not) a model
republic occupying a new uncleared land.&nbsp; We cannot, as they
do in America, plan out a vast city on some delicious and healthy
site amid the virgin forest, with streets one hundred feet in
breadth, squares and boulevards already planted by God&rsquo;s
hand with majestic trees; and then leave the great design to be
hewn out of the wilderness, street after street, square after
square, by generations yet unborn.&nbsp; That too is a
magnificent ideal; but it cannot be ours.&nbsp; And it is well
for us, I believe, that it cannot.&nbsp; The great value of land,
the enormous amount of vested interests, the necessity of keeping
to ancient sites around which labour, as in Manchester, or
commerce, as in Bristol, has clustered itself on account of
natural advantages, all these things make any attempts to rebuild
in cities impossible.&nbsp; But they will cause us at last, I
believe, to build better things than cities.&nbsp; They will
issue in a complete interpenetration of city and of country, a
complete fusion of their different modes of life, and a
combination of the advantages of both, such as no country in the
world has ever seen.&nbsp; We shall have, I believe and trust,
ere another generation has past, model lodging-houses springing
up, not in the heart of the town, but on the hills around it; and
those will be&mdash;economy, as well as science and good
government, will compel them to be&mdash;not ill-built rows of
undrained cottages, each rented for awhile, and then left to run
into squalidity and disrepair, but huge blocks of building, each
with its common eating-house, bar, baths, washhouses,
reading-room, common conveniences of every kind, where, in free
and pure country air, the workman will enjoy comforts which our
own grandfathers could not command, and at a lower price than
that which he now pays for such accommodation as I should be
ashamed to give to my own horses; while from these great blocks
of building, branch lines will convey the men to or from their
work by railroad, without loss of time, labour, or health.</p>
<p>Then the city will become what it ought to be; the workshop,
and not the dwelling-house, of a mighty and healthy people.&nbsp;
The old foul alleys, as they become gradually depopulated, will
be replaced by fresh warehouses, fresh public buildings; and the
city, in spite of all its smoke and dirt, will become a place on
which the workman will look down with pride and joy, because it
will be to him no longer a prison and a poison-trap, but merely a
place for honest labour.</p>
<p>This, gentlemen and ladies, is my ideal; and I cannot but hope
and believe that I shall live to see it realised here and there,
gradually and cautiously (as is our good and safe English habit),
but still earnestly and well.&nbsp; Did I see but the movement
commenced in earnest, I should be inclined to cry a &ldquo;Nunc
Domine dimittis&rdquo;&mdash;I have lived long enough to see a
noble work begun, which cannot but go on and prosper, so
beneficial would it be found.&nbsp; I tell you, that but this
afternoon, as the Bath train dashed through the last cutting, and
your noble vale and noble city opened before me, I looked round
upon the overhanging crags, the wooded glens, and said to myself:
There, upon the rock in the free air and sunlight, and not here,
beneath yon pall of smoke by the lazy pools and festering tidal
muds, ought the Bristol workman to live.&nbsp; Oh that I may see
the time when on the blessed Sabbath eve these hills shall swarm
as thick with living men as bean-fields with the summer bees;
when the glens shall ring with the laughter of ten thousand
children, with limbs as steady, and cheeks as ruddy, as those of
my own lads and lasses at home; and the artisan shall find his
Sabbath a day of rest indeed, in which not only soul but body may
gather health and nerve for the week&rsquo;s work, under the
soothing and purifying influences of those common natural sights
and sounds which God has given as a heritage even to the gipsy on
the moor; and of which no man can be deprived without making his
life a burden to himself, perhaps a burden to those around
him.</p>
<p>But it will be asked: Will such improvements pay?&nbsp; I
respect that question.&nbsp; I do not sneer at it, and regard it,
as some are too apt to do, as a sign of the mercenary and
money-loving spirit of the present age.&nbsp; I look on it as a
healthy sign of the English mind; a sign that we believe, as the
old Jews did, that political and social righteousness is
inseparably connected with wealth and prosperity.&nbsp; The old
Psalms and prophets have taught us that lesson; and God forbid
that we should forget it.&nbsp; The world is right well made; and
the laws of trade and of social economy, just as much as the laws
of nature, are divine facts, and only by obeying them can we
thrive.&nbsp; And I had far sooner hear a people asking of every
scheme of good, Will it pay? than throwing themselves headlong
into that merely sentimental charity to which superstitious
nations have always been prone&mdash;charity which effects no
permanent good, which, whether in Hindostan or in Italy, debases,
instead of raising, the suffering classes, because it breaks the
laws of social economy.</p>
<p>No, let us still believe that if a thing is right, it will
sooner or later pay; and in social questions, make the
profitableness of any scheme a test of its rightness.&nbsp; It is
a rough test; not an infallible one at all, but it is a fair one
enough to work by.</p>
<p>And as for the improvements at which I have hinted, I will
boldly answer that they will pay.</p>
<p>They will pay directly and at once, in the saving of
poor-rates.&nbsp; They will pay by exterminating epidemics, and
numberless chronic forms of disease which now render thousands
burdens on the public purse; consumers, instead of producers of
wealth.&nbsp; They will pay by gradually absorbing the dangerous
classes; and removing from temptation and degradation a
generation yet unborn.&nbsp; They will pay in the increased
content, cheerfulness, which comes with health in increased
goodwill of employed towards employers.&nbsp; They will pay by
putting the masses into a state fit for education.&nbsp; They
will pay, too, in such fearful times as these, by the increased
physical strength and hardihood of the town populations.&nbsp;
For it is from the city, rather than from the country, that our
armies must mainly be recruited.&nbsp; Not only is the townsman
more ready to enlist than the countryman, because in the town the
labour market is most likely to be overstocked; but the townsman
actually makes a better soldier than the countryman.&nbsp; He is
a shrewder, more active, more self-helping man; give him but the
chances of maintaining the same physical strength and health as
the countryman, and he will support the honour of the British
arms as gallantly as the Highlander or the Connaughtman, and
restore the days when the invincible prentice-boys of London
carried terror into the heart of foreign lands.&nbsp; In all
ages, in all times, whether for war or for peace, it will
pay.&nbsp; The true wealth of a nation is the health of her
masses.</p>
<p>It may seem to some here that I have dealt too much throughout
this lecture with merely material questions; that I ought to have
spoken more of intellectual progress; perhaps, as a clergyman,
more also of spiritual and moral regeneration.</p>
<p>I can only answer, that if this be a fault on my part, it is a
deliberate one.&nbsp; I have spoken, whether rightly or wrongly,
concerning what I know&mdash;concerning matters which are to me
articles of faith altogether indubitable, irreversible,
Divine.</p>
<p>Be it that these are merely questions of physical
improvement.&nbsp; I see no reason in that why they should be
left to laymen, or urged only on worldly grounds and
self-interest.&nbsp; I do not find that when urged on those
grounds, the advice is listened to.&nbsp; I believe that it will
not be listened to until the consciences of men, as well as their
brains, are engaged in these questions; until they are put on
moral grounds, shown to have connection with moral laws; and so
made questions not merely of interest, but of duty, honour,
chivalry.</p>
<p>I cannot but see, moreover, how many phenomena, which are
supposed to be spiritual, are simply physical; how many cases
which are referred to my profession, are properly the object of
the medical man.&nbsp; I cannot but see, that unless there be
healthy bodies, it is impossible in the long run to have a
generation of healthy souls; I cannot but see that mankind are as
prone now as ever to deny the sacredness and perfection of
God&rsquo;s physical universe, as an excuse for their own
ignorance and neglect thereof; to search the highest heaven for
causes which lie patent at their feet, and like the heathen of
old time, to impute to some capricious anger of the gods
calamities which spring from their own greed, haste, and
ignorance.</p>
<p>And, therefore, because I am a priest, and glory in the name
of a priest, I have tried to fulfil somewhat of that which seems
to me the true office of a priest&mdash;namely, to proclaim to
man the Divine element which exists in all, even the smallest
thing, because each thing is a thought of God himself; to make
men understand that God is indeed about their path and about
their bed, spying out all their ways; that they are indeed
fearfully and wonderfully made, and that God&rsquo;s hand lies
for ever on them, in the form of physical laws, sacred,
irreversible, universal, reaching from one end of the universe to
the other; that whosoever persists in breaking those laws, reaps
his sure punishment of weakness and sickness, sadness and
self-reproach; that whosoever causes them to be broken by others,
reaps his sure punishment in finding that he has transformed his
fellow-men into burdens and curses, instead of helpmates and
blessings.&nbsp; To say this, is a priest&rsquo;s duty; and then
to preach the good news that the remedy is patent, easy, close at
hand; that many of the worst evils which afflict humanity may be
exterminated by simple common sense, and the justice and mercy
which does to others as it would be done by; to awaken men to the
importance of the visible world, that they may judge from thence
the higher importance of that invisible world whereof this is but
the garment and the type; and in all times and places, instead of
keeping the key of knowledge to pamper one&rsquo;s own power or
pride, to lay that key frankly and trustfully in the hand of
every human being who hungers after truth, and to say: Child of
God, this key is thine as well as mine.&nbsp; Enter boldly into
thy Father&rsquo;s house, and behold the wonder, the wisdom, the
beauty of its laws and its organisms, from the mightiest planet
over thy head, to the tiniest insect beneath thy feet.&nbsp; Look
at it, trustfully, joyfully, earnestly; for it is thy
heritage.&nbsp; Behold its perfect fitness for thy life here; and
judge from thence its fitness for thy nobler life hereafter.</p>

225</span>HEROISM.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an open question whether the
policeman is not demoralising us; and that in proportion as he
does his duty well; whether the perfection of justice and safety,
the complete &ldquo;preservation of body and goods,&rdquo; may
not reduce the educated and comfortable classes into that lap-dog
condition in which not conscience, but comfort, doth make cowards
of us all.&nbsp; Our forefathers had, on the whole, to take care
of themselves; we find it more convenient to hire people to take
care of us.&nbsp; So much the better for us, in some respects;
but, it may be, so much the worse in others.&nbsp; So much the
better; because, as usually results from the division of labour,
these people, having little or nothing to do save to take care of
us, do so far better than we could; and so prevent a vast amount
of violence and wrong, and therefore of misery, especially to the
weak; for which last reason we will acquiesce in the existence of
policemen and lawyers, as we do in the results of arbitration, as
the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; The odds in war are in favour of
the bigger bully, in arbitration in favour of the bigger rogue;
and it is a question whether the lion or the fox be the safer
guardian of human interests.&nbsp; But arbitration prevents war;
and that, in three cases out of four, is full reason for
employing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the lap-dog condition, whether in dogs or
in men, is certainly unfavourable to the growth of the higher
virtues.&nbsp; Safety and comfort are good, indeed, for the good;
for the brave, the self-originating, the earnest.&nbsp; They give
to such a clear stage and no favour, wherein to work unhindered
for their fellow-men.&nbsp; But for the majority, who are neither
brave, self-originating, nor earnest, but the mere puppets of
circumstance, safety and comfort may, and actually do, merely
make their lives mean and petty, effeminate and dull.&nbsp;
Therefore their hearts must be awakened, as often as possible, to
take exercise enough for health; and they must be reminded,
perpetually and importunately, of what a certain great
philosopher called, &ldquo;whatsoever things are true,
honourable, just, pure, lovely, and of good report;&rdquo;
&ldquo;if there be any manhood, and any just praise, to think of
such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pettiness and dulness of our modern life is just what
keeps alive our stage, to which people go to see something a
little less petty, a little less dull, than what they see at
home.&nbsp; It is, too, the cause of&mdash;I had almost said the
excuse for&mdash;the modern rage for sensational novels.&nbsp;
Those who read them so greedily are conscious, poor souls, of
capacities in themselves of passion and action for good and evil,
for which their frivolous humdrum daily life gives no room, no
vent.&nbsp; They know too well that human nature can be more
fertile, whether in weeds and poisons, or in flowers and fruits,
than it is usually in the streets and houses of a well-ordered
and tolerably sober city.&nbsp; And because the study of human
nature is, after all, that which is nearest to everyone and most
interesting to everyone, therefore they go to fiction, since they
cannot go to fact, to see what they themselves might be had they
the chance; to see what fantastic tricks before high heaven men
and women like themselves can play, and how they play them.</p>
<p>Well, it is not for me to judge, for me to blame.&nbsp; I will
only say that there are those who cannot read sensational novels,
or, indeed, any novels at all, just because they see so many
sensational novels being enacted round them in painful facts of
sinful flesh and blood.&nbsp; There are those, too, who have
looked in the mirror too often to wish to see their own
disfigured visage in it any more; who are too tired of themselves
and ashamed of themselves to want to hear of people like
themselves; who want to hear of people utterly unlike themselves,
more noble, and able, and just, and sweet, and pure; who long to
hear of heroism and to converse with heroes; and who, if by
chance they meet with an heroic act, bathe their spirits in that,
as in May-dew, and feel themselves thereby, if but for an hour,
more fair.</p>
<p>If any such shall chance to see these words, let me ask them
to consider with me that one word Hero, and what it means.</p>
<p>Hero; Heroic; Heroism.&nbsp; These words point to a phase of
human nature, the capacity for which we all have in ourselves,
which is as startling and as interesting in its manifestations as
any, and which is always beautiful, always ennobling, and
therefore always attractive to those whose hearts are not yet
seared by the world or brutalised by self-indulgence.</p>
<p>But let us first be sure what the words mean.&nbsp; There is
no use talking about a word till we have got at its
meaning.&nbsp; We may use it as a cant phrase, as a party cry on
platforms; we may even hate and persecute our fellow-men for the
sake of it: but till we have clearly settled in our own minds
what a word means, it will do for fighting with, but not for
working with.&nbsp; Socrates of old used to tell the young
Athenians that the ground of all sound knowledge was&mdash;to
understand the true meaning of the words which were in their
mouths all day long; and Socrates was a wiser man than we shall
ever see.&nbsp; So, instead of beginning an oration in praise of
heroism, I shall ask my readers to think with me what heroism
is.</p>
<p>Now, we shall always get most surely at the meaning of a word
by getting at its etymology&mdash;that is, at what it meant at
first.&nbsp; And if heroism means behaving like a hero, we must
find out, it seems to me, not merely what a hero may happen to
mean just now, but what it meant in the earliest human speech in
which we find it.</p>
<p>A hero or a heroine, then, among the old Homeric Greeks, meant
a man or woman who was like the gods; and who, from that
likeness, stood superior to his or her fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
Gods, heroes, and men, is a threefold division of rational
beings, with which we meet more than once or twice.&nbsp; Those
grand old Greeks felt deeply the truth of the poet&rsquo;s
saying&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how poor a thing is man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But more: the Greeks supposed these heroes to be, in some way
or other, partakers of a divine nature; akin to the gods;
usually, either they, or some ancestor of theirs, descended from
a god or goddess.&nbsp; Those who have read Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Juventus Mundi&rdquo; will remember the section (cap. ix.
&sect; 6) on the modes of the approximation between the divine
and the human natures; and whether or not they agree with the
author altogether, all will agree, I think, that the first idea
of a hero or a heroine was a godlike man or godlike woman.</p>
<p>A godlike man.&nbsp; What varied, what infinite forms of
nobleness that word might include, ever increasing, as
men&rsquo;s notions of the gods became purer and loftier, or,
alas! decreasing, as their notions became degraded.&nbsp; The old
Greeks, with that intense admiration of beauty which made them,
in after ages, the master-sculptors and draughtsmen of their own,
and, indeed, of any age, would, of course, require in their hero,
their god-like man, beauty and strength, manners too, and
eloquence, and all outward perfections of humanity, and neglect
his moral qualities.&nbsp; Neglect, I say, but not ignore.&nbsp;
The hero, by virtue of his kindred with the gods, was always
expected to be a better man than common men, as virtue was then
understood.&nbsp; And how better?&nbsp; Let us see.</p>
<p>The hero was at least expected to be more reverent than other
men to those divine beings of whose nature he partook, whose
society he might enjoy even here on earth.&nbsp; He might be
unfaithful to his own high lineage; he might misuse his gifts by
selfishness and self-will; he might, like Ajax, rage with mere
jealousy and wounded pride till his rage ended in shameful
madness and suicide.&nbsp; He might rebel against the very gods,
and all laws of right and wrong, till he perished his
&#7936;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&lambda;&#943;&eta;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Smitten down, blind in his pride, for a sign and a
terror to mortals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he ought to have, he must have, to be true to his name of
Hero, justice, self-restraint, and
&alpha;&#7984;&delta;&#974;&sigmaf;&mdash;that highest form of
modesty, for which we have, alas! no name in the English tongue;
that perfect respect for the feelings of others which springs out
of perfect self-respect.&nbsp; And he must have too&mdash;if he
were to be a hero of the highest type&mdash;the instinct of
helpfulness; the instinct that, if he were a kinsman of the gods,
he must fight on their side, through toil and danger, against all
that was unlike them, and therefore hateful to them.&nbsp; Who
loves not the old legends, unsurpassed for beauty in the
literature of any race, in which the hero stands out as the
deliverer, the destroyer of evil?&nbsp; Theseus ridding the land
of robbers, and delivering it from the yearly tribute of boys and
maidens to be devoured by the Minotaur; Perseus slaying the
Gorgon, and rescuing Andromeda from the sea-beast; Heracles with
his twelve famous labours against giants and monsters; and all
the rest&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Who dared, in the god-given might of their
manhood,<br />
Greatly to do and to suffer, and far in the fens and the
forests<br />
Smite the devourers of men, heaven-hated brood of the giants;<br
/>
Transformed, strange, without like, who obey not the
golden-haired rulers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are figures whose divine moral beauty has sunk into the
hearts, not merely of poets or of artists, but of men and women
who suffered and who feared; the memory of them, fables though
they may have been, ennobled the old Greek heart; they ennobled
the heart of Europe in the fifteenth century, at the re-discovery
of Greek literature.&nbsp; So far from contradicting the
Christian ideal, they harmonised with&mdash;I had almost said
they supplemented&mdash;that more tender and saintly ideal of
heroism which had sprung up during the earlier Middle Ages.&nbsp;
They justified, and actually gave a new life to, the old
noblenesses of chivalry, which had grown up in the later Middle
Ages as a necessary supplement of active and manly virtue to the
passive and feminine virtue of the cloister.&nbsp; They inspired,
mingling with these two other elements, a literature both in
England, France, and Italy, in which the three elements, the
saintly, the chivalrous, and the Greek heroic, have become one
and undistinguishable, because all three are human, and all three
divine; a literature which developed itself in Ariosto, in Tasso,
in the Hypnerotomachia, the Arcadia, the Euphues, and other
forms, sometimes fantastic, sometimes questionable, but which
reached its perfection in our own Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fairy
Queen&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps the most admirable poem which has ever
been penned by mortal man.</p>
<p>And why?&nbsp; What has made these old Greek myths live, myths
though they be, and fables, and fair dreams?&nbsp;
What&mdash;though they have no body, and, perhaps, never
had&mdash;has given them an immortal soul, which can speak to the
immortal souls of all generations to come?</p>
<p>What but this, that in them&mdash;dim it may be and
undeveloped, but still there&mdash;lies the divine idea of
self-sacrifice as the perfection of heroism, of self-sacrifice,
as the highest duty and the highest joy of him who claims a
kindred with the gods?</p>
<p>Let us say, then, that true heroism must involve
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; Those stories certainly involve it, whether
ancient or modern, which the hearts, not of philosophers merely,
or poets, but of the poorest and the most ignorant, have accepted
instinctively as the highest form of moral beauty&mdash;the
highest form, and yet one possible to all.</p>

earth:&rdquo; and so was knocked on the head, and died surely a
hero&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Those soldiers of the Birkenhead,
keeping their ranks to let the women and children escape, while
they watched the sharks who in a few minutes would be tearing
them limb from limb.&nbsp; Or, to go across the
Atlantic&mdash;for there are heroes in the Far West&mdash;Mr.
Bret Harte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flynn of Virginia,&rdquo; on the
Central Pacific Railway&mdash;the place is shown to
travellers&mdash;who sacrificed his life for his married
comrade:</p>
<blockquote><p>There, in the drift,<br />
Back to the wall,<br />
He held the timbers<br />
Ready to fall.<br />
Then in the darkness<br />
I heard him call:<br />
&ldquo;Run for your life, Jake!<br />
Run for your wife&rsquo;s sake!<br />
Don&rsquo;t wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all<br />
Heard in the din&mdash;<br />
Heard of Tom Flynn&mdash;<br />
Flynn of Virginia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the engineer, again, on the Mississippi, who, when the
steamer caught fire, held, as he had sworn he would, her bow
against the bank, till every soul save he got safe on shore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through the hot black breath of the burning
boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Bludso&rsquo;s voice was heard;<br />
And they all had trust in his cussedness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knew he would keep his word.<br />
And sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born, they all got off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Afore the smokestacks fell;<br />
And Bludso&rsquo;s ghost went up alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the smoke of the Prairie Belle.</p>
<p>He weren&rsquo;t no saint&mdash;but at the judgment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d run my chance with Jim<br />
&rsquo;Longside of some pious gentlemen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t shake hands with him.<br />
He&rsquo;d seen his duty&mdash;a dead sure thing&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And went for it there and then;<br />
And Christ is not going to be too hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a man that died for men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which gallant poem of Colonel John Hay&rsquo;s&mdash;and he
has written many gallant and beautiful poems&mdash;I have but one
demurrer: Jim Bludso did not merely do his duty but more than his
duty.&nbsp; He did a voluntary deed, to which he was bound by no
code or contract, civil or moral; just as he who introduced me to
that poem won his Victoria Cross&mdash;as many a cross, Victoria
and other, has been won&mdash;by volunteering for a deed to which
he, too, was bound by no code or contract, military or
moral.&nbsp; And it is of the essence of self-sacrifice, and
therefore of heroism, that it should be voluntary; a work of
supererogation, at least towards society and man; an act to which
the hero or heroine is not bound by duty, but which is above
though not against duty.</p>
<p>Nay, on the strength of that same element of self-sacrifice, I
will not grudge the epithet &ldquo;heroic,&rdquo; which my
revered friend Mr. Darwin justly applies to the poor little
monkey, who once in his life did that which was above his duty;
who lived in continual terror of the great baboon, and yet, when
the brute had sprung upon his friend the keeper, and was tearing
out his throat, conquered his fear by love, and, at the risk of
instant death, sprang in turn upon his dreaded enemy, and bit and
shrieked till help arrived.</p>
<p>Some would nowadays use that story merely to prove that the
monkey&rsquo;s nature and the man&rsquo;s nature are, after all,
one and the same.&nbsp; Well: I, at least, have never denied that
there is a monkey-nature in man, as there is a peacock-nature,
and a swine-nature, and a wolf-nature&mdash;of all which four I
see every day too much.&nbsp; The sharp and stern distinction
between men and animals, as far as their natures are concerned,
is of a more modern origin than people fancy.&nbsp; Of old the
Assyrian took the eagle, the ox, and the lion&mdash;and not
unwisely&mdash;as the three highest types of human
capacity.&nbsp; The horses of Homer might be immortal, and weep
for their master&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The animals and monsters of
Greek myth&mdash;like the Ananzi spider of Negro
fable&mdash;glide insensibly into speech and reason.&nbsp;
Birds&mdash;the most wonderful of all animals in the eyes of a
man of science or a poet&mdash;are sometimes looked on as wiser,
and nearer to the gods, than man.&nbsp; The Norseman&mdash;the
noblest and ablest human being, save the Greek, of whom history
can tell us&mdash;was not ashamed to say of the bear of his
native forests that he had &ldquo;ten men&rsquo;s strength and
eleven men&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; How could Reinecke Fuchs
have gained immortality, in the Middle Ages and since, save by
the truth of its too solid and humiliating theorem&mdash;that the
actions of the world of men were, on the whole, guided by
passions but too exactly like those of the lower animals?&nbsp; I
have said, and say again, with good old Vaughan:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how mean a thing is man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I cannot forget that many an old Greek poet or sage, and
many a sixteenth and seventeenth century one, would have
interpreted the monkey&rsquo;s heroism from quite a different
point of view; and would have said that the poor little creature
had been visited suddenly by some &ldquo;divine
afflatus&rdquo;&mdash;an expression quite as philosophical and
quite as intelligible as most philosophic formulas which I read
nowadays&mdash;and had been thus raised for the moment above his
abject selfish monkey-nature, just as man requires to be raised
above his.&nbsp; But that theory belongs to a philosophy which is
out of date and out of fashion, and which will have to wait a
century or two before it comes into fashion again.</p>
<p>And now, if self-sacrifice and heroism be, as I believe,
identical, I must protest against the use of the word
&ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; which is growing too common in
newspaper-columns, in which we are told of an &ldquo;enormous
sacrifice of life;&rdquo; an expression which means merely that a
great many poor wretches have been killed, quite against their
own will, and for no purpose whatsoever; no sacrifice at all,
unless it be one to the demons of ignorance, cupidity, or
mismanagement.</p>
<p>The stout Whig undergraduate understood better the meaning of
such words, who, when asked, &ldquo;In what sense might Charles
the First be said to be a martyr?&rdquo; answered, &ldquo;In the
same sense that a man might be said to be a martyr to the
gout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I must protest, in like wise, against a misuse of the
words &ldquo;hero.&rdquo; &ldquo;heroism,&rdquo;
&ldquo;heroic,&rdquo; which is becoming too common, namely,
applying them to mere courage.&nbsp; We have borrowed the misuse,
I believe, as we have more than one beside, from the French
press.&nbsp; I trust that we shall neither accept it, nor the
temper which inspires it.&nbsp; It may be convenient for those
who flatter their nation, and especially the military part of it,
into a ruinous self-conceit, to frame some such syllogism as
this: &ldquo;Courage is heroism: every Frenchman is naturally
courageous: therefore every Frenchman is a hero.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
we, who have been trained at once in a sounder school of morals,
and in a greater respect for facts, and for language as the
expression of facts, shall be careful, I hope, not to trifle thus
with that potent and awful engine&mdash;human speech.&nbsp; We
shall eschew likewise, I hope, a like abuse of the word
&ldquo;moral,&rdquo; which has crept from the French press now
and then, not only into our own press, but into the writings of
some of our military men, who, as Englishmen, should have known
better.&nbsp; We were told again and again, during the late war,
that the moral effect of such a success had been great; that the
<i>morale</i> of the troops was excellent; or again, that the
<i>morale</i> of the troops had suffered, or even that they were
somewhat demoralised.&nbsp; But when one came to test what was
really meant by these fine words, one discovered that morals had
nothing to do with the facts which they expressed; that the
troops were in the one case actuated simply by the animal passion
of hope, in the other simply by the animal passion of fear.&nbsp;
This abuse of the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; has crossed, I am
sorry to say, the Atlantic; and a witty American, whom we must
excuse, though we must not imitate, when some one had been
blazing away at him with a revolver, he being unarmed, is said to
have described his very natural emotions on the occasion, by
saying that he felt dreadfully demoralised.&nbsp; We, I hope,
shall confine the word &ldquo;demoralisation,&rdquo; as our
generals of the last century would have done, when applied to
soldiers, to crime, including, of course, the neglect of duty or
of discipline; and we shall mean by the word
&ldquo;heroism,&rdquo; in like manner, whether applied to a
soldier or to any human being, not mere courage, not the mere
doing of duty, but the doing of something beyond duty; something
which is not in the bond; some spontaneous and unexpected act of
self-devotion.</p>
<p>I am glad, but not surprised, to see that Miss Yonge has held
to this sound distinction in her golden little book of
&ldquo;Golden Deeds,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Obedience, at all
costs and risks, is the very essence of a soldier&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; It has the solid material, but it has hardly the
exceptional brightness, of a golden deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that it is very difficult to draw the line between mere
obedience to duty and express heroism.&nbsp; I know also that it
would be both invidious and impertinent in an utterly unheroic
personage like me, to try to draw that line; and to sit at home
at ease, analysing and criticising deeds which I could not do
myself; but&mdash;to give an instance or two of what I mean:</p>
<p>To defend a post as long as it is tenable is not heroic.&nbsp;
It is simple duty.&nbsp; To defend it after it has become
untenable, and even to die in so doing, is not heroic, but a
noble madness, unless an advantage is to be gained thereby for
one&rsquo;s own side.&nbsp; Then, indeed, it rises towards, if
not into, the heroism of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Who, for example, will not endorse the verdict of all ages on
the conduct of those Spartans at Thermopyl&aelig;, when they sat
&ldquo;combing their yellow hair for death&rdquo; on the
sea-shore?&nbsp; They devoted themselves to hopeless destruction;
but why?&nbsp; They felt&mdash;I must believe that, for they
behaved as if they felt&mdash;that on them the destinies of the
Western World might hang; that they were in the forefront of the
battle between civilisation and barbarism, between freedom and
despotism; and that they must teach that vast mob of Persian
slaves, whom the officers of the Great King were driving with
whips up to their lance-points, that the spirit of the old heroes
was not dead; and that the Greek, even in defeat and death, was a
mightier and a nobler man than they.&nbsp; And they did their
work.&nbsp; They produced, if you will, a &ldquo;moral&rdquo;
effect, which has lasted even to this very day.&nbsp; They struck
terror into the heart, not only of the Persian host, but of the
whole Persian empire.&nbsp; They made the event of that war
certain, and the victories of Salamis and Plat&aelig;a
comparatively easy.&nbsp; They made Alexander&rsquo;s conquest of
the East, one hundred and fifty years afterwards, not only
possible at all, but permanent when it came; and thus helped to
determine the future civilisation of the whole world.</p>
<p>They did not, of course, foresee all this.&nbsp; No great or
inspired man can foresee all the consequences of his deeds; but
these men were, as I hold inspired to see somewhat at least of
the mighty stake for which they played; and to count their lives
worthless, if Sparta had sent them thither to help in that great
game.</p>
<p>Or shall we refuse the name of heroic to those three German
cavalry regiments who, in the battle of Mars-la-Tour, were bidden
to hurl themselves upon the chassepots and mitrailleuses of the
unbroken French infantry, and went to almost certain death, over
the corpses of their comrades, on and in and through, reeling man
over horse, horse over man, and clung like bull-dogs to their
work, and would hardly leave, even at the bugle-call, till in one
regiment thirteen officers out of nineteen were killed or
wounded?&nbsp; And why?</p>
<p>Because the French army must be stopped, if it were but for a
quarter of an hour.&nbsp; A respite must be gained for the
exhausted Third Corps.&nbsp; And how much might be done, even in
a quarter of an hour, by men who knew when, and where, and why to
die!&nbsp; Who will refuse the name of heroes to these men?&nbsp;
And yet they, probably, would have utterly declined the
honour.&nbsp; They had but done that which was in the bond.&nbsp;
They were but obeying orders after all.&nbsp; As Miss Yonge well
says of all heroic persons: &ldquo;&lsquo;I have but done that
which it was my duty to do,&rsquo; is the natural answer of those
capable of such actions.&nbsp; They have been constrained to them
by duty or pity; have never deemed it possible to act otherwise;
and did not once think of themselves in the matter at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last true words bring us to another element in heroism:
its simplicity.&nbsp; Whatsoever is not simple; whatsoever is
affected, boastful, wilful, covetous, tarnishes, even destroys,
the heroic character of a deed; because all these faults spring
out of self.&nbsp; On the other hand, wherever you find a
perfectly simple, frank, unconscious character, there you have
the possibility, at least, of heroic action.&nbsp; For it is
nobler far to do the most commonplace duty in the household, or
behind the counter, with a single eye to duty, simply because it
must be done&mdash;nobler far, I say, than to go out of your way
to attempt a brilliant deed, with a double mind, and saying to
yourself not only&mdash;&ldquo;This will be a brilliant
deed,&rdquo; but also&mdash;&ldquo;and it will pay me, or raise
me, or set me off, into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heroism knows
no &ldquo;into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And therefore, again, I
must protest against applying the word &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; to
any deeds, however charitable, however toilsome, however
dangerous, performed for the sake of what certain French ladies,
I am told, call &ldquo;faire son salut&rdquo;&mdash;saving
one&rsquo;s soul in the world to come.&nbsp; I do not mean to
judge.&nbsp; Other and quite unselfish motives may be, and
doubtless often are, mixed up with that selfish one: womanly pity
and tenderness; love for, and desire to imitate, a certain
Incarnate ideal of self-sacrifice, who is at once human and
divine.&nbsp; But that motive of saving the soul, which is too
often openly proposed and proffered, is utterly unheroic.&nbsp;
The desire to escape pains and penalties hereafter by pains and
penalties here; the balance of present loss against future
gain&mdash;what is this but selfishness extended out of this
world into eternity?&nbsp; &ldquo;Not worldliness,&rdquo; indeed,
as a satirist once said with bitter truth, &ldquo;but
other-worldliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover&mdash;and the young and the enthusiastic should also
bear this in mind&mdash;though heroism means the going beyond the
limits of strict duty, it never means the going out of the path
of strict duty.&nbsp; If it is your duty to go to London, go
thither: you may go as much farther as you choose after
that.&nbsp; But you must go to London first.&nbsp; Do your duty
first; it will be time after that to talk of being heroic.</p>
<p>And therefore one must seriously warn the young, lest they
mistake for heroism and self-sacrifice what is merely pride and
self-will, discontent with the relations by which God has bound
them, and the circumstances which God has appointed for
them.&nbsp; I have known girls think they were doing a fine thing
by leaving uncongenial parents or disagreeable sisters, and
cutting out for themselves, as they fancied, a more useful and
elevated line of life than that of mere home duties; while, after
all, poor things, they were only saying, with the Pharisees of
old, &ldquo;Corban, it is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
profited by me;&rdquo; and in the name of God, neglecting the
command of God to honour their father and mother.</p>
<p>There are men, too, who will neglect their households and
leave their children unprovided for, and even uneducated, while
they are spending their money on philanthropic or religious
hobbies of their own.&nbsp; It is ill to take the
children&rsquo;s bread and cast it to the dogs; or even to the
angels.&nbsp; It is ill, I say, trying to make presents to God,
before we have tried to pay our debts to God.&nbsp; The first
duty of every man is to the wife whom he has married, and to the
children whom she has brought into the world; and to neglect them
is not heroism, but self-conceit; the conceit that a man is so
necessary to Almighty God, that God will actually allow him to do
wrong, if He can only thereby secure the man&rsquo;s invaluable
services.&nbsp; Be sure that every motive which comes not from
the single eye, every motive which springs from self, is by its
very essence unheroic, let it look as gaudy or as beneficent as
it may.</p>
<p>But I cannot go so far as to say the same of the love of
approbation&mdash;the desire for the love and respect of our
fellow-men.&nbsp; That must not be excluded from the list of
heroic motives.&nbsp; I know that it is, or may be proved to be,
by victorious analysis, an emotion common to us and the lower
animals.&nbsp; And yet no man excludes it less than that true
hero, St. Paul.</p>
<p>If those brave Spartans, if those brave Germans, of whom I
spoke just now, knew that their memories would be wept over and
worshipped by brave men and fair women, and that their names
would become watchwords to children in their fatherland, what is
that to us, save that it should make us rejoice, if we be truly
human, that they had that thought with them in their last moments
to make self-devotion more easy, and death more sweet?</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;is not the highest heroism that
which is free even from the approbation of our fellowmen, even
from the approbation of the best and wisest?&nbsp; The heroism
which is known only to our Father who seeth in secret?&nbsp; The
Godlike deeds alone in the lonely chamber?&nbsp; The Godlike
lives lived in obscurity?&mdash;a heroism rare among us men, who
live perforce in the glare and noise of the outer world: more
common among women; women of whom the world never hears; who, if
the world discovered them, would only draw the veil more closely
over their faces and their hearts, and entreat to be left alone
with God.&nbsp; True, they cannot always hide.&nbsp; They must
not always hide; or their fellow-creatures would lose the golden
lesson.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, it is of the essence of the
perfect and womanly heroism, in which, as in all spiritual forces
the woman transcends the man, that it would hide if it could.</p>
<p>And it was a pleasant thought to me, when I glanced lately at
the golden deeds of women in Miss Yonge&rsquo;s book&mdash;it was
a pleasant thought to me, that I could say to myself&mdash;Ah!
yes.&nbsp; These heroines are known, and their fame flies through
the mouths of men.&nbsp; But if so, how many thousands of
heroines there must have been, how many thousands there may be
now, of whom we shall never know.&nbsp; But still they are
there.&nbsp; They sow in secret the seed of which we pluck the
flower and eat the fruit, and know not that we pass the sower
daily in the street; perhaps some humble, ill-dressed woman,
earning painfully her own small sustenance.&nbsp; She who nurses
a bedridden mother, instead of sending her to the
workhouse.&nbsp; She who spends her heart and her money on a
drunken father, a reckless brother, on the orphans of a kinsman
or a friend.&nbsp; She who&mdash;But why go on with the long list
of great little heroisms, with which a clergyman at least comes
in contact daily&mdash;and it is one of the most ennobling
privileges of a clergyman&rsquo;s high calling that he does come
in contact with them&mdash;why go on, I say, save to commemorate
one more form of great little heroism&mdash;the commonest, and
yet the least remembered of all&mdash;namely, the heroism of an
average mother?&nbsp; Ah, when I think of that last broad fact, I
gather hope again for poor humanity; and this dark world looks
bright, this diseased world looks wholesome to me once
more&mdash;because, whatever else it is or is not full of, it is
at least full of mothers.</p>
<p>While the satirist only sneers, as at a stock butt for his
ridicule, at the managing mother trying to get her daughters
married off her hands by chicaneries and meannesses, which every
novelist knows too well how to draw&mdash;would to heaven he, or
rather, alas! she would find some more chivalrous employment for
his or her pen&mdash;for were they not, too, born of
woman?&mdash;I only say to myself&mdash;having had always a
secret fondness for poor Rebecca, though I love Esau more than
Jacob&mdash;Let the poor thing alone.&nbsp; With pain she brought
these girls into the world.&nbsp; With pain she educated them
according to her light.&nbsp; With pain she is trying to obtain
for them the highest earthly blessing of which she can conceive,
namely, to be well married; and if in doing that last, she
man&oelig;uvres a little, commits a few basenesses, even tells a
few untruths, what does all that come to, save this&mdash;that in
the confused intensity of her motherly self-sacrifice, she will
sacrifice for her daughters even her own conscience and her own
credit?&nbsp; We may sneer, if we will, at such a poor
hard-driven soul when we meet her in society; our duty, both as
Christians and ladies and gentlemen, seems to me to be&mdash;to
do for her something very different indeed.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Looking at the amount of great little
heroisms, which are being, as I assert, enacted around us every
day, no one has a right to say, what we are all tempted to say at
times: &ldquo;How can I be heroic?&nbsp; This is no heroic age,
setting me heroic examples.&nbsp; We are growing more and more
comfortable, frivolous, pleasure-seeking, money-making; more and
more utilitarian; more and more mercenary in our politics, in our
morals, in our religion; thinking less and less of honour and
duty, and more and more of loss and gain.&nbsp; I am born into an
unheroic time.&nbsp; You must not ask me to become heroic in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not deny that it is more difficult to be heroic, while
circumstances are unheroic round us.&nbsp; We are all too apt to
be the puppets of circumstances; all too apt to follow the
fashion; all too apt, like so many minnows, to take our colour
from the ground on which we lie, in hopes, like them, of
comfortable concealment, lest the new tyrant deity, called Public
Opinion, should spy us out, and, like Nebuchadnezzar of old, cast
us into a burning fiery furnace&mdash;which public opinion can
make very hot&mdash;for daring to worship any god or man save the
will of the temporary majority.</p>
<p>Yes, it is difficult to be anything but poor, mean,
insufficient, imperfect people, as like each other as so many
sheep; and, like so many sheep, having no will or character of
our own, but rushing altogether blindly over the same gap, in
foolish fear of the same dog, who, after all, dare not bite us;
and so it always was and always will be.</p>
<p>For the third time I say,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
above himself he can<br />
Exalt himself, how poor a thing is man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, nevertheless, any man or woman who <i>will</i>, in any
age and under any circumstances, can live the heroic life and
exercise heroic influences.</p>
<p>If any ask proof of this, I shall ask them, in return, to read
two novels; novels, indeed, but, in their method and their moral,
partaking of that heroic and ideal element, which will make them
live, I trust, long after thousands of mere novels have returned
to their native dust.&nbsp; I mean Miss Muloch&rsquo;s
&ldquo;John Halifax, Gentleman,&rdquo; and Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Esmond,&rdquo; two books which no man or woman ought to
read without being the nobler for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Halifax, Gentleman,&rdquo; is simply the history
of a poor young clerk, who rises to be a wealthy mill-owner in
the manufacturing districts, in the early part of this
century.&nbsp; But he contrives to be an heroic and ideal clerk,
and an heroic and ideal mill-owner; and that without doing
anything which the world would call heroic or ideal, or in
anywise stepping out of his sphere, minding simply his own
business, and doing the duty which lies nearest him.&nbsp; And
how?&nbsp; By getting into his head from youth the strangest
notion, that in whatever station or business he may be, he can
always be what he considers a gentleman; and that if he only
behaves like a gentleman, all must go right at last.&nbsp; A
beautiful book.&nbsp; As I said before, somewhat of an heroic and
ideal book.&nbsp; A book which did me good when first I read it;
which ought to do any young man good who will read it, and then
try to be, like John Halifax, a gentleman, whether in the shop,
the counting-house, the bank, or the manufactory.</p>
<p>The other&mdash;an even more striking instance of the
possibility, at least, of heroism anywhere and
everywhere&mdash;is Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Esmond.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the meaning of that book I can
speak with authority.&nbsp; For my dear and regretted friend told
me himself that my interpretation of it was the true one; that
this was the lesson which he meant men to learn therefrom.</p>
<p>Esmond is a man of the first half of the eighteenth century;
living in a coarse, drunken, ignorant, profligate, and altogether
unheroic age.&nbsp; He is&mdash;and here the high art and the
high morality of Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s genius is
shown&mdash;altogether a man of his own age.&nbsp; He is not a
sixteenth-century or a nineteenth-century man born out of
time.&nbsp; His information, his politics, his religion, are no
higher than of those round him.&nbsp; His manners, his views of
human life, his very prejudices and faults, are those of his
age.&nbsp; The temptations which he conquers are just those under
which the men around him fall.&nbsp; But how does he conquer
them?&nbsp; By holding fast throughout to honour, duty,
virtue.&nbsp; Thus, and thus alone, he becomes an ideal
eighteenth-century gentleman, an eighteenth-century hero.&nbsp;
This was what Mr. Thackeray meant&mdash;for he told me so
himself, I say&mdash;that it was possible, even in
England&rsquo;s lowest and foulest times, to be a gentleman and a
hero, if a man would but be true to the light within him.</p>
<p>But I will go farther.&nbsp; I will go from ideal fiction to
actual, and yet ideal, fact; and say that, as I read history, the
most unheroic age which the civilised world ever saw was also the
most heroic; that the spirit of man triumphed most utterly over
his circumstances at the very moment when those circumstances
were most against him.</p>
<p>How and why he did so is a question for philosophy in the
highest sense of that word.&nbsp; The fact of his having done so
is matter of history.&nbsp; Shall I solve my own riddle?</p>
<p>Then, have we not heard of the early Christian martyrs?&nbsp;
Is there a doubt that they, unlettered men, slaves, weak women,
even children, did exhibit, under an infinite sense of duty,
issuing in infinite self-sacrifice, a heroism such as the world
had never seen before; did raise the ideal of human nobleness a
whole stage&mdash;rather say, a whole heaven&mdash;higher than
before; and that wherever the tale of their great deeds spread,
men accepted, even if they did not copy, those martyrs as ideal
specimens of the human race, till they were actually worshipped
by succeeding generations, wrongly, it may be, but pardonably, as
a choir of lesser deities?</p>
<p>But is there, on the other hand, a doubt that the age in which
they were heroic was the most unheroic of all ages; that they
were bred, lived, and died, under the most debasing of
materialist tyrannies, with art, literature, philosophy, family
and national life dying, or dead around them, and in cities the
corruption of which cannot be told for very shame&mdash;cities,
compared with which Paris is the abode of Arcadian simplicity and
innocence?&nbsp; When I read Petronius and Juvenal, and recollect
that they were the contemporaries of the Apostles; when&mdash;to
give an instance which scholars, and perhaps, happily, only
scholars, can appreciate&mdash;I glance once more at
Trimalchio&rsquo;s feast, and remember that within a mile of that
feast St. Paul may have been preaching to a Christian
congregation, some of whom&mdash;for St. Paul makes no secret of
that strange fact&mdash;may have been, ere their conversion,
partakers in just such vulgar and bestial orgies as those which
were going on in the rich freedman&rsquo;s halls; after that, I
say, I can put no limit to the possibility of man&rsquo;s
becoming heroic, even though he be surrounded by a hell on earth;
no limit to the capacities of any human being to form for himself
or herself a high and pure ideal of human character; and, without
&ldquo;playing fantastic tricks before high heaven,&rdquo; to
carry out that ideal in every-day life; and in the most
commonplace circumstances, and the most menial occupations, to
live worthy of&mdash;as I conceive&mdash;our heavenly birthright,
and to imitate the heroes, who were the kinsmen of the gods.</p>

MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Speech in behalf of Ladies&rsquo;
Sanitary Association. <a name="citation257"></a><a
href="#footnote257" class="citation">[257]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> me begin by asking the ladies
who are interesting themselves in this good work, whether they
have really considered what they are about to do in carrying out
their own plans?&nbsp; Are they aware that if their Society
really succeeds, they will produce a very serious, some would
think a very dangerous, change in the state of this nation?&nbsp;
Are they aware that they would probably save the lives of some
thirty or forty per cent. of the children who are born in
England, and that therefore they would cause the subjects of
Queen Victoria to increase at a very far more rapid rate than
they do now?&nbsp; And are they aware that some very wise men
inform us that England is already over-peopled, and that it is an
exceedingly puzzling question where we shall soon be able to find
work or food for our masses, so rapidly do they increase already,
in spite of the thirty or forty per cent. which kind Nature
carries off yearly before they are five years old?&nbsp; Have
they considered what they are to do with all those children whom
they are going to save alive?&nbsp; That has to be thought of;
and if they really do believe, with some political economists,
that over-population is a possibility to a country which has the
greatest colonial empire that the world has ever seen; then I
think they had better stop in their course, and let the children
die, as they have been in the habit of dying.</p>
<p>But if, on the other hand, it seems to them, as I confess it
does to me, that the most precious thing in the world is a human
being; that the lowest, and poorest, and the most degraded of
human beings is better than all the dumb animals in the world;
that there is an infinite, priceless capability in that creature,
fallen as it may be; a capability of virtue, and of social and
industrial use, which, if it is taken in time, may be developed
up to a pitch, of which at first sight the child gives no hint
whatsoever; if they believe again, that of all races upon earth
now, the English race is probably the finest, and that it gives
not the slightest sign whatever of exhaustion; that it seems to
be on the whole a young race, and to have very great capabilities
in it which have not yet been developed, and above all, the most
marvellous capability of adapting itself to every sort of climate
and every form of life, which any race, except the old Roman,
ever has had in the world; if they consider with me that it is
worth the while of political economists and social philosophers
to look at the map, and see that about four-fifths of the globe
cannot be said as yet to be in anywise inhabited or cultivated,
or in the state into which men could put it by a fair supply of
population, and industry, and human intellect: then, perhaps,
they may think with me that it is a duty, one of the noblest of
duties, to help the increase of the English race as much as
possible, and to see that every child that is born into this
great nation of England be developed to the highest pitch to
which we can develop him in physical strength and in beauty, as
well as in intellect and in virtue.&nbsp; And then, in that
light, it does seem to me, that this Institution&mdash;small now,
but I do hope some day to become great and to become the mother
institution of many and valuable children&mdash;is one of the
noblest, most right-minded, straightforward, and practical
conceptions that I have come across for some years.</p>
<p>We all know the difficulties of sanitary legislation.&nbsp;
One looks at them at times almost with despair.&nbsp; I have my
own reasons, with which I will not trouble this meeting, for
looking on them with more despair than ever: not on account of
the government of the time, or any possible government that could
come to England, but on account of the peculiar class of persons
in whom the ownership of the small houses has become more and
more vested, and who are becoming more and more, I had almost
said, the arbiters of the popular opinion, and of every election
of parliament.&nbsp; However, that is no business of ours here;
that must be settled somewhere else; and a fearfully long time,
it seems to me, it will be before it is settled.&nbsp; But, in
the meantime, what legislation cannot do, I believe private help,
and, above all, woman&rsquo;s help, can do even better.&nbsp; It
can do this; it can improve the condition of the working man: and
not only of him; I must speak also of the middle classes, of the
men who own the house in which the working man lives.&nbsp; I
must speak, too, of the wealthy tradesman; I must speak&mdash;it
is a sad thing to have to say it&mdash;of our own class as well
as of others.&nbsp; Sanitary reform, as it is called, or, in
plain English, the art of health, is so very recent a discovery,
as all true physical science is, that we ourselves and our own
class know very little about it, and practise it very
little.&nbsp; And this society, I do hope, will bear in mind that
it is not simply to seek the working man, not only to go into the
foul alley: but it is to go to the door of the farmer, to the
door of the shopkeeper, aye, to the door of ladies and gentlemen
of the same rank as ourselves.&nbsp; Women can do in that work
what men cannot do.&nbsp; The private correspondence, private
conversation, private example, of ladies, above all of married
women, of mothers of families, may do what no legislation can
do.&nbsp; I am struck more and more with the amount of disease
and death I see around me in all classes, which no sanitary
legislation whatsoever could touch, unless you had a complete
house-to-house visitation by some government officer, with powers
to enter every dwelling, to drain it, and ventilate it; and not
only that, but to regulate the clothes and the diet of every
inhabitant, and that among all ranks.&nbsp; I can conceive of
nothing short of that, which would be absurd and impossible, and
would also be most harmful morally, which would stop the present
amount of disease and death which I see around me, without some
such private exertion on the part of women, above all of mothers,
as I do hope will spring from this institution more and more.</p>
<p>I see this, that three persons out of every four are utterly
unaware of the general causes of their own ill-health, and of the
ill-health of their children.&nbsp; They talk of their
&ldquo;afflictions,&rdquo; and their &ldquo;misfortunes;&rdquo;
and, if they be pious people, they talk of &ldquo;the will of
God,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;the visitation of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
do not like to trench upon those matters here; but when I read in
my book and in your book, &ldquo;that it is not the will of our
Father in Heaven that one of these little ones should
perish,&rdquo; it has come to my mind sometimes with very great
strength that that may have a physical application as well as a
spiritual one; and that the Father in Heaven who does not wish
the child&rsquo;s soul to die, may possibly have created that
child&rsquo;s body for the purpose of its not dying except in a
good old age.&nbsp; For not only in the lower class, but in the
middle and upper classes, when one sees an unhealthy family, then
in three cases out of four, if one will take time, trouble, and
care enough, one can, with the help of the doctor, who has been
attending them, run the evil home to a very different cause than
the will of God; and that is, to stupid neglect, stupid
ignorance, or what is just as bad, stupid indulgence.</p>
<p>Now, I do believe that if those tracts which you are
publishing, which I have read and of which I cannot speak too
highly, are spread over the length and breadth of the land, and
if women&mdash;clergymen&rsquo;s wives, the wives of
manufacturers and of great employers, district visitors and
schoolmistresses, have these books put into their hands, and are
persuaded to spread them, and to enforce them, by their own
example and by their own counsel&mdash;that then, in the course
of a few years, this system being thoroughly carried out, you
would see a sensible and large increase in the rate of
population.&nbsp; When you have saved your children alive, then
you must settle what to do with them.&nbsp; But a living dog is
better than a dead lion; I would rather have the living child,
and let it take its chance, than let it return to
God&mdash;wasted.&nbsp; O! it is a distressing thing to see
children die.&nbsp; God gives the most beautiful and precious
thing that earth can have, and we just take it and cast it away;
we toss our pearls upon the dunghill and leave them.&nbsp; A
dying child is to me one of the most dreadful sights in the
world.&nbsp; A dying man, a man dying on the field of
battle&mdash;that is a small sight; he has taken his chance; he
is doing his duty; he has had his excitement; he has had his
glory, if that will be any consolation to him; if he is a wise
man, he has the feeling that he is dying for his country and his
queen: and that is, and ought to be, enough for him.&nbsp; I am
not horrified or shocked at the sight of the man who dies on the
field of battle; let him die so.&nbsp; It does not horrify or
shock me, again, to see a man dying in a good old age, even
though the last struggle be painful, as it too often is.&nbsp;
But it does shock me, it does make me feel that the world is
indeed out of joint, to see a child die.&nbsp; I believe it to be
a priceless boon to the child to have lived for a week, or a day:
but oh, what has God given to this thankless earth, and what has
the earth thrown away; and in nine cases out of ten, from its own
neglect and carelessness!&nbsp; What that boy might have been,
what he might have done as an Englishman, if he could have lived
and grown up healthy and strong!&nbsp; And I entreat you to bear
this in mind, that it is not as if our lower or our middle
classes were not worth saving: bear in mind that the physical
beauty, strength, intellectual power of the middle
classes&mdash;the shopkeeping class, the farming class, down to
the lowest working class&mdash;whenever you give them a fair
chance, whenever you give them fair food and air, and physical
education of any kind, prove them to be the finest race in
Europe.&nbsp; Not merely the aristocracy, splendid race as they
are, but down and down and down to the lowest labouring man, to
the navigator&mdash;why, there is not such a body of men in
Europe as our navigators; and no body of men perhaps have had a
worse chance of growing to be what they are; and yet see what
they have done!&nbsp; See the magnificent men they become, in
spite of all that is against them, dragging them down, tending to
give them rickets and consumption, and all the miserable diseases
which children contract; see what men they are, and then conceive
what they might be!&nbsp; It has been said, again and again, that
there are no more beautiful race of women in Europe than the
wives and daughters of our London shopkeepers; and yet there are
few races of people who lead a life more in opposition to all
rules of hygiene.&nbsp; But, in spite of all that, so wonderful
is the vitality of the English race, they are what they are; and
therefore we have the finest material to work upon that people
ever had.&nbsp; And, therefore, again, we have the less excuse if
we do allow English people to grow up puny, stunted, and
diseased.</p>
<p>Let me refer again to that word that I used; death&mdash;the
amount of death.&nbsp; I really believe there are hundreds of
good and kind people who would take up this subject with their
whole heart and soul if they were aware of the magnitude of the
evil.&nbsp; Lord Shaftesbury told you just now that there were
one hundred thousand preventable deaths in England every
year.&nbsp; So it is.&nbsp; We talk of the loss of human life in
war.&nbsp; We are the fools of smoke and noise; because there are
cannon-balls, forsooth, and swords and red coats; and because it
costs a great deal of money, and makes a great deal of talk in
the papers, we think: What so terrible as war?&nbsp; I will tell
you what is ten times, and ten thousand times, more terrible than
war, and that is outraged Nature.&nbsp; War, we are discovering
now, is the clumsiest and most expensive of all games; we are
finding that if you wish to commit an act of cruelty and folly,
the most costly one that you can commit is to contrive to shoot
your fellow-men in war.&nbsp; So it is; and thank God that so it
is; but Nature, insidious, inexpensive, silent, sends no roar of
cannon, no glitter of arms to do her work; she gives no warning
note of preparation; she has no protocols, nor any diplomatic
advances, whereby she warns her enemy that war is coming.&nbsp;
Silently, I say, and insidiously she goes forth; no! she does not
even go forth; she does not step out of her path; but quietly, by
the very same means by which she makes alive, she puts to death;
and so avenges herself of those who have rebelled against
her.&nbsp; By the very same laws by which every blade of grass
grows, and every insect springs to life in the sunbeam, she
kills, and kills, and kills, and is never tired of killing; till
she has taught man the terrible lesson he is so slow to learn,
that, Nature is only conquered by obeying her.</p>
<p>And bear in mind one thing more.&nbsp; Man has his courtesies
of war, and his chivalries of war; he does not strike the unarmed
man; he spares the woman and the child.&nbsp; But Nature is as
fierce when she is offended, as she is bounteous and kind when
she is obeyed.&nbsp; She spares neither woman nor child.&nbsp;
She has no pity; for some awful, but most good reason, she is not
allowed to have any pity.&nbsp; Silently she strikes the sleeping
babe, with as little remorse as she would strike the strong man,
with the spade or the musket in his hand.&nbsp; Ah! would to God
that some man had the pictorial eloquence to put before the
mothers of England the mass of preventable suffering, the mass of
preventable agony of mind and body, which exists in England year
after year; and would that some man had the logical eloquence to
make them understand that it is in their power, in the power of
the mothers and wives of the higher class, I will not say to stop
it all&mdash;God only knows that&mdash;but to stop, as I believe,
three-fourths of it.</p>
<p>It is in the power, I believe, of any woman in this room to
save three or four lives&mdash;human lives&mdash;during the next
six months.&nbsp; It is in your power, ladies; and it is so
easy.&nbsp; You might save several lives apiece, if you choose,
without, I believe, interfering with your daily business, or with
your daily pleasure; or, if you choose, with your daily
frivolities, in any way whatsoever.&nbsp; Let me ask, then, those
who are here, and who have not yet laid these things to heart:
Will you let this meeting to-day be a mere passing matter of two
or three hours&rsquo; interest, which you may go away and forget
for the next book or the next amusement?&nbsp; Or will you be in
earnest?&nbsp; Will you learn&mdash;I say it openly&mdash;from
the noble chairman, how easy it is to be in earnest in life; how
every one of you, amid all the artificial complications of
English society in the nineteenth century, can find a work to do,
a noble work to do, a chivalrous work to do&mdash;just as
chivalrous as if you lived in any old magic land, such as Spenser
talked of in his &ldquo;Fa&euml;rie Queene;&rdquo; how you can be
as true a knight-errant or lady-errant in the present century, as
if you had lived far away in the dark ages of violence and
rapine?&nbsp; Will you, I ask, learn this?&nbsp; Will you learn
to be in earnest; and to use the position, and the station, and
the talent that God has given you to save alive those who should
live?&nbsp; And will you remember that it is not the will of your
Father that is in Heaven that one little one that plays in the
kennel outside should perish, either in body or in soul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cholera, as was to be expected,
has reappeared in England again; and England, as was to be
expected, has taken no sufficient steps towards meeting it; so
that if, as seems but too probable, the plague should spread next
summer, we may count with tolerable certainty upon a loss of some
ten thousand lives.</p>
<p>That ten thousand, or one thousand, innocent people should
die, of whom most, if not all, might be saved alive, would seem
at first sight a matter serious enough for the attention of
&ldquo;philanthropists.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who abhor the practice
of hanging one man would, one fancies, abhor equally that of
poisoning many; and would protest as earnestly against the
painful capital punishment of diarrhoea as against the painless
one of hempen rope.&nbsp; Those who demand mercy for the Sepoy,
and immunity for the Coolie women of Delhi, unsexed by their own
brutal and shameless cruelty, would, one fancies, demand mercy
also for the British workman, and immunity for his wife and
family.&nbsp; One is therefore somewhat startled at finding that
the British nation reserves to itself, though it forbids to its
armies, the right of putting to death unarmed and unoffending
men, women, and children.</p>
<p>After further consideration, however, one finds that there
are, as usual, two sides to the question.&nbsp; One is bound,
indeed, to believe, even before proof, that there are two
sides.&nbsp; It cannot be without good and sufficient reason that
the British public remains all but indifferent to sanitary
reform; that though the science of epidemics, as a science, has
been before the world for more than twenty years, nobody believes
in it enough to act upon it, save some few dozen of fanatics,
some of whom have (it cannot be denied) a direct pecuniary
interest in disturbing what they choose to term the
poison-manufactories of free and independent Britons.</p>
<p>Yes; we should surely respect the expressed will and
conviction of the most practical of nations, arrived at after the
experience of three choleras, stretching over a whole
generation.&nbsp; Public opinion has declared against the
necessity of sanitary reform: and is not public opinion known to
be, in these last days, the Ithuriel&rsquo;s spear which is to
unmask and destroy all the follies, superstitions, and cruelties
of the universe?&nbsp; The immense majority of the British nation
will neither cleanse themselves nor let others cleanse them: and
are we not governed by majorities?&nbsp; Are not majorities,
confessedly, always in the right, even when smallest, and a show
of hands a surer test of truth than any amount of wisdom,
learning, or virtue?&nbsp; How much more, then, when a whole free
people is arrayed, in the calm magnificence of self-confident
conservatism, against a few innovating and perhaps sceptical
philosophasters?&nbsp; Then surely, if ever, vox populi is vox
coeli.</p>
<p>And, in fact, when we come to examine the first and commonest
objection against sanitary reformers, we find it perfectly
correct.&nbsp; They are said to be theorists, dreamers of the
study, who are ignorant of human nature; and who in their
materialist optimism, have forgotten the existence of moral evil
till they almost fancy at times that they can set the world right
simply by righting its lowest material arrangements.&nbsp; The
complaint is perfectly true.&nbsp; They have been ignorant of
human nature; they have forgotten the existence of moral evil;
and if any religious periodical should complain of their denying
original sin, they can only answer that they did in past years
fall into that folly, but that subsequent experience has utterly
convinced them of the truth of the doctrine.</p>
<p>For, misled by this ignorance of human nature, they expected
help, from time to time, from various classes of the community,
from whom no help (as they ought to have known at first) is to be
gotten.&nbsp; Some, as a fact, expected the assistance of the
clergy, and especially of the preachers of those denominations
who believe that every human being, by the mere fact of his birth
into this world, is destined to endless torture after death,
unless the preacher can find an opportunity to deliver him
therefrom before he dies.&nbsp; They supposed that to such
preachers the mortal lives of men would be inexpressibly
precious; that any science which held out a prospect of retarding
death in the case of &ldquo;lost millions&rdquo; would be hailed
as a heavenly boon, and would be carried out with the fervour of
men who felt that for the soul&rsquo;s sake no exertion was too
great in behalf of the body.</p>
<p>A little more reflection would have quashed their vain
hope.&nbsp; They would have recollected that each of these
preachers was already connected with a congregation; that he had
already a hold on them, and they on him; that he was bound to
provide for their spiritual wants before going forth to seek for
fresh objects of his ministry.&nbsp; They would have recollected
that on the old principle (and a very sound one) of a bird in the
hand being worth two in the bush, the minister of a congregation
would feel it his duty, as well as his interest, not to defraud
his flock of his labours by spending valuable time on a secular
subject like sanitary reform, in the hope of possibly preserving
a few human beings, whose souls he might hereafter (and that
again would be merely a possibility) benefit.</p>
<p>They would have recollected, again, that these congregations
are almost exclusively composed of those classes who have little
or nothing to fear from epidemics, and (what is even more
important) who would have to bear the expenses of sanitary
improvements.&nbsp; But so sanguine, so reckless of human
conditions had their theories made them, that they actually
expected that parish rectors, already burdened with over-work and
vestry quarrels&mdash;nay, even that preachers who got their
bread by pew-rents, and whose life-long struggle was, therefore,
to keep those pews filled, and those renters in good
humour&mdash;should astound the respectable house-owners and
ratepayers who sat beneath them by the appalling words:
&ldquo;You, and not the &lsquo;Visitation of God,&rsquo; are the
cause of epidemics; and of you, now that you are once fairly
warned of your responsibility, will your brothers&rsquo; blood be
required.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conceive Sanitary Reformers expecting this
of &ldquo;ministers,&rdquo; let their denomination be what it
might&mdash;many of the poor men, too, with a wife and seven
children!&nbsp; Truly has it been said, that nothing is so cruel
as the unreasonableness of a fanatic.</p>
<p>They forgot, too, that sanitary science, like geology, must be
at first sight &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; in the eyes of the priests
of all denominations, at least till they shall have arrived at a
much higher degree of culture than they now possess.</p>
<p>Like geology, it interferes with that Deus e machin&acirc;
theory of human affairs which has been in all ages the stronghold
of priestcraft.&nbsp; That the Deity is normally absent, and not
present; that he works on the world by interference, and not by
continuous laws; that it is the privilege of the priesthood to
assign causes for these &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; and
&ldquo;visitations&rdquo; of the Almighty, and to tell mankind
why He is angry with them, and has broken the laws of nature to
punish them&mdash;this, in every age, has seemed to the majority
of priests a doctrine to be defended at all hazards; for without
it, so they hold, their occupation were gone at once. <a
name="citation276"></a><a href="#footnote276"
class="citation">[276]</a>&nbsp; No wonder, then, if they view
with jealousy a set of laymen attributing these
&ldquo;judgments&rdquo; to purely chemical laws, and to misdoings
and ignorance which have as yet no place in the ecclesiastical
catalogue of sins.&nbsp; True, it may be that the Sanitary
Reformers are right; but they had rather not think so.&nbsp; And
it is very easy not to think so.&nbsp; They only have to ignore,
to avoid examining, the facts.&nbsp; Their canon of utility is a
peculiar one; and with facts which do not come under that canon
they have no concern.&nbsp; It may be true, for instance, that
the eighteenth century, which to the clergy is a period of
scepticism, darkness, and spiritual death, is the very century
which saw more done for science, for civilisation, for
agriculture, for manufacture, for the prolongation and support of
human life than any preceding one for a thousand years and
more.&nbsp; What matter?&nbsp; That is a &ldquo;secular&rdquo;
question, of which they need know nothing.&nbsp; And sanitary
reform (if true) is just such another; a matter (as slavery has
been seen to be by the preachers of the United States) for the
legislator, and not for those whose kingdom is &ldquo;not of this
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others again expected, with equal wisdom, the assistance of
the political economist.&nbsp; The fact is undeniable, but at the
same time inexplicable.&nbsp; What they could have found in the
doctrines of most modern political economists which should lead
them to suppose that human life would be precious in their eyes,
is unknown to the writer of these pages.&nbsp; Those whose
bugbear has been over-population, whose motto has been an
euphuistic version of</p>
<blockquote><p>The more the merrier; but the fewer the better
fare&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cannot be expected to lend their aid in increasing the
population by saving the lives of two-thirds of the children who
now die prematurely in our great cities; and so still further
overcrowding this unhappy land with those helpless and expensive
sources of national poverty&mdash;rational human beings, in
strength and health.</p>
<p>Moreover&mdash;and this point is worthy of serious
attention&mdash;that school of political economy, which has now
reached its full development, has taken all along a view of
man&rsquo;s relation to Nature diametrically opposite to that
taken by the Sanitary Reformer, or indeed by any other men of
science.&nbsp; The Sanitary Reformer holds, in common with the
chemist or the engineer, that Nature is to be obeyed only in
order to conquer her; that man is to discover the laws of her
existing phenomena, in order that he may employ them to create
new phenomena himself; to turn the laws which he discovers to his
own use; if need be, to counteract one by another.&nbsp; In this
power, it has seemed to them, lay his dignity as a rational
being.&nbsp; It was this, the power of invention, which made him
a progressive animal, not bound as the bird and the bee are, to
build exactly as his forefathers built five thousand years
ago.</p>
<p>By political economy alone has this faculty been denied to
man.&nbsp; In it alone he is not to conquer nature, but simply to
obey her.&nbsp; Let her starve him, make him a slave, a bankrupt,
or what not, he must submit, as the savage does to the hail and
the lightning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laissez-faire,&rdquo; says the
&ldquo;Science du n&eacute;ant,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Science de la
mis&egrave;re,&rdquo; as it has truly and bitterly been called;
&ldquo;Laissez-faire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Analyse economic questions if
you will: but beyond analysis you shall not step.&nbsp; Any
attempt to raise political economy to its synthetic stage is to
break the laws of nature, to fight against facts&mdash;as if
facts were not made to be fought against and conquered, and put
out of the way, whensoever they interfere in the least with the
welfare of any human being.&nbsp; The drowning man is not to
strike out for his life lest by keeping his head above water he
interfere with the laws of gravitation.&nbsp; Not that the
political economist, or any man, can be true to his own
fallacy.&nbsp; He must needs try his hand at the synthetic method
though he forbids it to the rest of the world: but the only
deductive hint which he has as yet given to mankind is, quaintly
enough, the most unnatural &ldquo;eidolon spec&ucirc;s&rdquo;
which ever entered the head of a dehumanised pedant&mdash;namely,
that once famous &ldquo;Preventive Check,&rdquo; which, if a
nation did ever apply it&mdash;as it never will&mdash;could
issue, as every doctor knows, in nothing less than the
questionable habits of abortion, child-murder, and unnatural
crime.</p>
<p>The only explanation of such conduct (though one which the men
themselves will hardly accept) is this&mdash;that they secretly
share somewhat in the doubt which many educated men have of the
correctness of their inductions; that these same laws of
political economy (where they leave the plain and safe
subject-matter of trade) have been arrived at somewhat too
hastily; that they are, in plain English, not quite sound enough
yet to build upon; and that we must wait for a few more facts
before we begin any theories.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; At least,
these men, in their present temper of mind, are not likely to be
very useful to the Sanitary Reformer.</p>
<p>Would that these men, or the clergy, had been the only bruised
reed in which the Sanitary Reformers put their trust.&nbsp; They
found another reed, however, and that was Public Opinion; but
they forgot that (whatever the stump-orators may say about this
being the age of electric thought, when truth flashes triumphant
from pole to pole, etc.) we have no proof whatsoever that the
proportion of fools is less in this generation than in those
before it, or that truth, when unpalatable (as it almost always
is), travels any faster than it did five hundred years ago.&nbsp;
They forgot that every social improvement, and most mechanical
ones, have had to make their way against laziness, ignorance,
envy, vested wrongs, vested superstitions, and the whole vis
inerti&aelig; of the world, the flesh, and the devil.&nbsp; They
were guilty indeed, in this case, not merely of ignorance of
human nature, but of forgetfulness of fact.&nbsp; Did they not
know that the excellent New Poor-law was greeted with the curses
of those very farmers and squires who now not only carry it out
lovingly and willingly to the very letter, but are often too
ready to resist any improvement or relaxation in it which may be
proposed by that very Poor-law Board from which it
emanated?&nbsp; Did they not know that Agricultural Science,
though of sixty years&rsquo; steady growth, has not yet
penetrated into a third of the farms of England; and that
hundreds of farmers still dawdle on after the fashion of their
forefathers, when by looking over the next hedge into their
neighbour&rsquo;s field they might double their produce and their
profits?&nbsp; Did they not know that the adaptation of steam to
machinery would have progressed just as slowly, had it not been a
fact patent to babies that an engine is stronger than a horse;
and that if cotton, like wheat and beef, had taken twelve months
to manufacture, instead of five minutes, Manchester foresight
would probably have been as short and as purblind as that of the
British farmer?&nbsp; What right had they to expect a better
reception for the facts of Sanitary Science?&mdash;facts which
ought to, and ultimately will, disturb the vested interests of
thousands, will put them to inconvenience, possibly at first to
great expense; and yet facts which you can neither see nor
handle, but must accept and pay hundreds of thousands of pounds
for, on the mere word of a doctor or inspector who gets his
living thereby.&nbsp; Poor John Bull!&nbsp; To expect that you
would accept such a gospel cheerfully was indeed to expect too
much!</p>
<p>But yet, though the public opinion of the mass could not be
depended on, there was a body left, distinct from the mass, and
priding itself so much on that distinctness that it was ready to
say at times&mdash;of course in more courteous&mdash;at least in
what it considered more Scriptural language: &ldquo;This people
which knoweth not the law is accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; To it
therefore&mdash;to the religious world&mdash;some over-sanguine
Sanitary Reformers turned their eyes.&nbsp; They saw in it ready
organised (so it professed) for all good works, a body such as
the world had never seen before.&nbsp; Where the religions public
of Byzantium, Alexandria, or Rome numbered hundreds, that of
England numbered its thousands.&nbsp; It was divided, indeed, on
minor points, but it was surely united by the one aim of saving
every man his own soul, and of professing the deepest reverence
for that Divine Book which tells men that the way to attain that
aim is, to be good and to do good; and which contains among other
commandments this one&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shaft not
kill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its wealth was enormous.&nbsp; It possessed so
much political power, that it would have been able to command
elections, to compel ministers, to encourage the weak hearts of
willing but fearful clergymen by fair hopes of deaneries and
bishoprics.&nbsp; Its members were no clique of unpractical
fanatics&mdash;no men less.&nbsp; Though it might number among
them a few martinet ex-post-captains, and noblemen of
questionable sanity, capable of no more practical study than that
of unfulfilled prophecy, the vast majority of them were
landowners, merchants, bankers, commercial men of all ranks, full
of worldly experience, and of the science of organisation,
skilled all their lives in finding and in employing men and
money.&nbsp; What might not be hoped from such a body, to whom
that commercial imperium in imperio of the French Protestants
which the edict of Nantes destroyed was poor and weak?&nbsp; Add
to this that these men&rsquo;s charities were boundless; that
they were spending yearly, and on the whole spending wisely and
well, ten times as much as ever was spent before in the world, on
educational schemes, missionary schemes, church building,
reformatories, ragged schools, needlewomen&rsquo;s
charities&mdash;what not?&nbsp; No object of distress, it seemed,
could be discovered, no fresh means of doing good devised, but
these men&rsquo;s money poured bountifully and at once into that
fresh channel, and an organisation sprang up for the employment
of that money, as thrifty and as handy as was to be expected from
the money-holding classes of this great commercial nation.</p>
<p>What could not these men do?&nbsp; What were they not bound by
their own principles to do?&nbsp; No wonder that some weak
men&rsquo;s hearts beat high at the thought.&nbsp; What if the
religious world should take up the cause of Sanitary
Reform?&nbsp; What if they should hail with joy a cause in which
all, whatever their theological differences, might join in one
sacred crusade against dirt, degradation, disease, and
death?&nbsp; What if they should rise at the hustings to inquire
of every candidate: &ldquo;Will you or will you not, pledge
yourself to carry out Sanitary Reform in the place for which you
are elected, and let the health and the lives of the local poor
be that &lsquo;local interest&rsquo; which you are bound by your
election to defend?&nbsp; Do you confess your ignorance of the
subject?&nbsp; Then know, sir, that you are unfit, at this point
of the nineteenth century, to be a member of the British
Senate.&nbsp; You go thither to make laws &lsquo;for the
preservation of life and property.&rsquo;&nbsp; You confess
yourself ignorant of those physical laws, stronger and wider than
any which you can make, upon which all human life depends, by
infringing which the whole property of a district is
depreciated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, what might not the
&ldquo;religious world,&rdquo; and the public opinion of
&ldquo;professing Christians,&rdquo; have done in the last
twenty&mdash;ay, in the last three years?</p>
<p>What it has done, is too patent to need comment here.</p>
<p>The reasons of so strange an anomaly are to be approached with
caution.&nbsp; It is a serious thing to impute motives to a vast
body of men, of whom the majority are really respectable,
kind-hearted, and useful; and if in giving one&rsquo;s deliberate
opinion one seems to blame them, let it be recollected that the
blame lies not so much on them as on their teachers: on those
who, for some reasons best known to themselves, have truckled to,
and even justified, the self-satisfied ignorance of a comfortable
moneyed class.</p>
<p>But let it be said, and said boldly, that these men&rsquo;s
conduct in the matter of Sanitary Reform seems at least to show
that they value virtue, not for itself, but for its future
rewards.&nbsp; To the great majority of these men (with some
heroic exceptions, whose names may be written in no subscription
list, but are surely written in the book of life) the great truth
has never been revealed, that good is the one thing to be done,
at all risks, for its own sake; that good is absolutely and
infinitely better than evil, whether it pay or not to all
eternity.&nbsp; Ask one of them: &ldquo;Is it better to do right
and go to hell, or do wrong and go to heaven?&rdquo;&mdash;they
will look at you puzzled, half angry, suspecting you of some
secret blasphemy, and, if hard pressed, put off the new and
startling question by saying, that it is absurd to talk of an
impossible hypothesis.&nbsp; The human portion of their virtue is
not mercenary, for they are mostly worthy men; the religious part
thereof, that which they keep for Sundays and for charitable
institutions, is too often mercenary, though they know it
not.&nbsp; Their religion is too often one of &ldquo;Loss and
Gain,&rdquo; as much as Father Newman&rsquo;s own; and their
actions, whether they shall call them &ldquo;good works&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fruits of faith,&rdquo; are so much spiritual capital, to
be repaid with interest at the last day.</p>
<p>Therefore, like all religionists, they are most anxious for
those schemes of good which seem most profitable to themselves
and to the denomination to which they belong; and the best of all
such works is, of course, as with all religionists, the making of
proselytes.&nbsp; They really care for the bodies, but still they
care more for the souls, of those whom they assist&mdash;and not
wrongly either, were it not that to care for a man&rsquo;s soul
usually means, in the religious world, to make him think with
you; at least to lay him under such obligations as to give you
spiritual power over him.&nbsp; Therefore it is that all
religious charities in England are more and more conducted, just
as much as those of Jesuits and Oratorians, with an ulterior view
of proselytism; therefore it is that the religious world, though
it has invented, perhaps, no new method of doing good; though it
has been indebted for educational movements, prison visitations,
infant schools, ragged schools, and so forth, to Quakers,
cobblers, even in some cases to men whom they call infidels, have
gladly adopted each and every one of them, as fresh means of
enlarging the influence or the numbers of their own
denominations, and of baiting for the body in order to catch the
soul.&nbsp; A fair sample of too much of their labour may be seen
anywhere, in those tracts in which the prettiest stories, with
the prettiest binding and pictures, on the most
secular&mdash;even, sometimes, scientific&mdash;of subjects, end
by a few words of pious exhortation, inserted by a different hand
from that which indites the &ldquo;carnal&rdquo; mass of the
book.&nbsp; They did not invent the science, or the art of
story-telling, or the woodcutting, or the plan of getting books
up prettily&mdash;or, indeed, the notion of instructing the
masses at all; but finding these things in the hands of
&ldquo;the world,&rdquo; they have &ldquo;spoiled the
Egyptians,&rdquo; and fancy themselves beating Satan with his own
weapons.</p>
<p>If, indeed, these men claimed boldly all printing, all
woodcutting, all story-telling, all human arts and sciences, as
gifts from God Himself; and said, as the book which they quote so
often says: &ldquo;The Spirit of God gives man understanding,
these, too, are His gifts, sacred, miraculous, to be accounted
for to Him,&rdquo; then they would be consistent; and then, too,
they would have learnt, perhaps, to claim Sanitary Science for a
gift divine as any other: but nothing, alas! is as yet further
from their creed.&nbsp; And therefore it is that Sanitary Reform
finds so little favour in their eyes.&nbsp; You have so little in
it to show for your work.&nbsp; You may think you have saved the
lives of hundreds; but you cannot put your finger on one of them:
and they know you not; know not even their own danger, much less
your beneficence.&nbsp; Therefore, you have no lien on them, not
even that of gratitude; you cannot say to a man: &ldquo;I have
prevented you having typhus, therefore you must attend my
chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Sanitary Reform makes no
proselytes.&nbsp; It cannot be used as a religious engine.&nbsp;
It is too simply human, too little a respecter of persons, too
like to the works of Him who causes His sun to shine on the evil
and the good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust,
and is good to the unthankful and to the evil, to find much
favour in the eyes of a generation which will compass sea and
land to make one proselyte.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Too like the works of our Father in heaven, as
indeed all truly natural and human science needs must be.&nbsp;
True, to those who believe that there is a Father in heaven, this
would, one supposes, be the highest recommendation.&nbsp; But how
many of this generation believe that?&nbsp; Is not their
doctrine, the doctrine to testify for which the religious world
exists, the doctrine which if you deny, you are met with one
universal frown and snarl&mdash;that man has no Father in heaven:
but that if he becomes a member of the religious world, by
processes varying with each denomination, he may&mdash;strange
paradox&mdash;create a Father for himself?</p>
<p>But so it is.&nbsp; The religious world has lost the belief
which even the elder Greeks and Romans had, of a &ldquo;Zeus,
Father of gods and men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even that it has lost.&nbsp;
Therefore have man and the simple human needs of man, no
sacredness in their eyes; therefore is Nature to them no longer
&ldquo;the will of God exprest in facts,&rdquo; and to break a
law of nature no longer to sin against Him who &ldquo;looked on
all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet they read their Bibles, and believe that they believe in
Him who stood by the lake-side in Galilee, and told men that not
a sparrow fell to the ground without their Father&rsquo;s
knowledge&mdash;and that they were of more value than many
sparrows.&nbsp; Do those words now seem to some so self-evident
as to be needless?&nbsp; They will never seem so to the Sanitary
Reformer, who has called on the &ldquo;British Public&rdquo; to
exert themselves in saving the lives of thousands yearly; and has
received practical answers which will furnish many a bitter jest
for the Voltaire of the next so-called &ldquo;age of
unbelief,&rdquo; or fill a sad, but an instructive chapter in
some future enlarged edition of Adelung&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Human Folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All but despairing, Sanitary Reformers have turned again and
again to her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.&nbsp; Alas for
them!&nbsp; The Government was ready and willing enough to
help.&nbsp; The wicked world said: &ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; It
will create a new department.&nbsp; It will give them more places
to bestow.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the real reason of the willingness of
Government seems to be that those who compose it are thoroughly
awake to the importance of the subject.</p>
<p>But what can a poor Government do, whose strength consists (as
that of all English Governments must) in not seeming too strong;
which is allowed to do anything, only on condition of doing the
minimum?&nbsp; Of course, a Government is morally bound to keep
itself in existence; for is it not bound to believe that it can
govern the country better than any other knot of men?&nbsp; But
its only chance of self-preservation is to know, with
Hesiod&rsquo;s wise man, &ldquo;how much better the half is than
the whole,&rdquo; and to throw over many a measure which it would
like to carry, for the sake of saving the few which it can
carry.</p>
<p>An English Government, nowadays, is simply at the mercy of the
forty or fifty members of the House of Commons who are crotchety
enough or dishonest enough to put it unexpectedly in a minority;
and they, with the vast majority of the House, are becoming more
and more the delegates of that very class which is most opposed
to Sanitary Reform.&nbsp; The honourable member goes to
Parliament not to express his opinions, (for he has stated most
distinctly at the last election that he has no opinions
whatsoever), but to protect the local interests of his
constituents.&nbsp; And the great majority of those constituents
are small houseowners&mdash;the poorer portion of the middle
class.&nbsp; Were he to support Government in anything like a
sweeping measure of Sanitary Reform, woe to his seat at the next
election; and he knows it; and therefore, even if he allow the
Government to have its Central Board of Health, he will take good
care, for his own sake, that the said Board shall not do too
much, and that it shall not compel his constituents to do
anything at all.</p>
<p>No wonder, that while the attitude of the House of Commons is
such toward a matter which involves the lives of thousands
yearly, some educated men should be crying that Representative
institutions are on their trial, and should sigh for a strong
despotism.</p>
<p>There is an answer, nevertheless, to such sentimentalists, and
one hopes that people will see the answer for themselves, and
that the infection of Imperialism, which seems spreading somewhat
rapidly, will be stopped by common sense and honest observation
of facts.</p>
<p>A despotism doubtless could carry out Sanitary Reform: but
doubtless, also, it would not.</p>
<p>A despot in the nineteenth century knows well how insecure his
tenure is.&nbsp; His motto must be, &ldquo;Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die;&rdquo; and, therefore, the first objects of
his rule will be, private luxury and a standing army; while if he
engage in public works, for the sake of keeping the populace
quiet, they will be certain not to be such as will embroil him
with the middle classes, while they will win him no additional
favour with the masses, utterly unaware of their necessity.&nbsp;
Would the masses of Paris have thanked Louis Napoleon the more
if, instead of completing the Tuileries, he had sewered the St.
Antoine?&nbsp; All arguments to the contrary are utterly
fallacious, which are drawn from ancient despotisms, Roman,
Eastern, Peruvian, or other; and for this simple reason, that
they had no middle class.&nbsp; If they did work well (which is a
question) it was just because they had no middle class&mdash;that
class, which in a free State is the very life of a nation, and
yet which, in a despotism, is sure to be the root of its
rottenness.&nbsp; For a despot who finds, as Louis Napoleon has
done, a strong middle class already existing, must treat it as he
does; he must truckle to it, pander to its basest propensities,
seem to make himself its tool, in order that he may make it
his.&nbsp; For the sake of his own life, he must do it; and were
a despot to govern England to-morrow, we should see that the man
who was shrewd enough to have climbed to that bad eminence, would
be shrewd enough to know that he could scarcely commit a more
suicidal act than, by some despotic measure of Sanitary Reform,
to excite the ill-will of all the most covetous, the most stupid,
and the most stubborn men in every town of England.</p>
<p>There is another answer, too, to &ldquo;Imperialists&rdquo;
who talk of Representative institutions being on their trial, and
let it be made boldly just now.</p>
<p>It will be time to talk of Representative institutions being
good or bad, when the people of England are properly
represented.</p>
<p>In the first place, it does seem only fair that the class who
suffer most from epidemics should have some little share in the
appointment of the men on whose votes extermination of epidemics
now mainly depends.&nbsp; But that is too large a question to
argue here.&nbsp; Let the Government see to it in the coming
session.</p>
<p>Yet how much soever, or how little soever, the suffrage be
extended in the direction of the working man, let it be extended,
at least in some equal degree, in the direction of the educated
man.&nbsp; Few bodies in England now express the opinions of
educated men less than does the present House of Commons.&nbsp;
It is not chosen by educated men, any more than it is by
<i>prol&eacute;taires</i>.&nbsp; It is not, on an average,
composed of educated men; and the many educated men who are in it
have, for the most part, to keep their knowledge very much to
themselves, for fear of hurting the feelings of &ldquo;ten-pound
Jack,&rdquo; or of the local attorney who looks after
Jack&rsquo;s vote.&nbsp; And therefore the House of Commons does
not represent public opinion.</p>
<p>For, to enounce with fitting clearness a great but
much-forgotten truth, To have an opinion, you must have an
opinion.</p>
<p>Strange: but true, and pregnant too.&nbsp; For, from it may be
deduced this corollary, that nine-tenths of what is called Public
Opinion is no opinion at all; for, on the matters which come
under the cognizance of the House of Commons (save where
superstition, as in the case of the Sabbath, or the Jew Bill,
sets folks thinking&mdash;generally on the wrong side), nine
people out of ten have no opinion at all; know nothing about the
matter, and care less; wherefore, having no opinions to be
represented, it is not important whether that nothing be
represented or not.</p>
<p>The true public opinion of England is composed of the opinions
of the shrewd, honest, practical men in her, whether educated or
not; and of such, thank God, there are millions: but it consists
also of the opinions of the educated men in her; men who have had
leisure and opportunity for study; who have some chance of
knowing the future, because they have examined the past; who can
compare England with other nations; English creeds, laws,
customs, with those of the rest of mankind;&mdash;who know
somewhat of humanity, human progress, human existence; who have
been practised in the processes of thought; and who, from study,
have formed definite opinions, differing doubtless in infinite
variety, but still all founded upon facts, by something like fair
and scientific induction.</p>
<p>Till we have this class of men fairly represented in the House
of Commons, there is little hope for Sanitary Reform: when it is
so represented, we shall have no reason to talk of Representative
institutions being on their trial.</p>
<p>And it is one of the few hopeful features of the present time,
that an attempt is at last being made to secure for educated men
of all professions a fair territorial representation.&nbsp; A
memorial to the Government has been presented, appended to which,
in very great numbers, are the names of men of note, of all
ranks, all shades in politics and religion, all
professions&mdash;legal, clerical, military, medical, and
literary.&nbsp; A list of names representing so much intellect,
so much learning, so much acknowledged moderation, so much good
work already done and acknowledged by the country, has never,
perhaps, been collected for any political purpose; and if their
scheme (the details of which are not yet made public) should in
anywise succeed, it will do more for the prospects of Sanitary
Reform than any forward movement of the quarter of a century.</p>
<p>For if Sanitary Reform, or perhaps any really progressive
measure, is to be carried out henceforth, we must go back to
something like the old principle of the English constitution, by
which intellect, as such, had its proper share in the public
councils.&nbsp; During those middle ages when all the intellect
and learning was practically possessed by the clergy, they
constituted a separate estate of the realm.&nbsp; This was the
old plan&mdash;the best which could be then devised.&nbsp; After
learning became common to the laity, the educated classes were
represented more and more only by such clever young men as could
be thrust into Parliament by the private patronage of the
aristocracy.&nbsp; Since the last Reform Bill, even that supply
of talent has been cut off; and the consequence has been, the
steady deterioration of our House of Commons toward such a level
of mediocrity as shall satisfy the ignorance of the practically
electing majority, namely, the tail of the middle class; men who
are apt to possess all the failings with few of the virtues of
those above them and below them; who have no more intellectual
training than the simple working man, and far less than the
average shopman, and who yet lose, under the influence of a small
competence, that practical training which gives to the working
man, made strong by wholesome necessity, chivalry, endurance,
courage, and self-restraint; whose business morality is made up
of the lowest and narrowest maxims of the commercial world,
unbalanced by that public spirit, that political knowledge, that
practical energy, that respect for the good opinion of his
fellows, which elevate the large employer.&nbsp; On the hustings,
of course, this description of the average free and independent
elector would be called a calumny; and yet, where is the member
of Parliament who will not, in his study, assent to its truth,
and confess, that of all men whom he meets, those who least
command his respect are those among his constituents to secure
whom he takes most trouble; unless, indeed, it be the
pettifoggers who manage his election for him?</p>
<p>Whether this is the class to whose public opinion the health
and lives of the masses are to be entrusted, is a question which
should be settled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile let every man who would awake to the importance of
Sanitary questions, do his best to teach and preach, in season
and out of season, and to instruct, as far as he can, that public
opinion which is as yet but public ignorance.&nbsp; Let him
throw, for instance, what weight he has into the &ldquo;National
Association for the Advancement of Social Science.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In it he will learn, as well as teach, not only on Sanitary
Reforms, but upon those cognate questions which must be
considered with it, if it is ever to be carried out.</p>
<p>Indeed, this new &ldquo;National Association&rdquo; seems the
most hopeful and practical move yet made by the
sanitarists.&nbsp; It may be laughed at somewhat at first, as the
British Association was; but the world will find after a while
that, like the British Association, it can do great things
towards moulding public opinion, and compel men to consider
certain subjects, simply by accustoming people to hear them
mentioned.&nbsp; The Association will not have existed in vain,
if it only removes that dull fear and suspicion with which
Englishmen are apt to regard a new subject, simply because it is
new.&nbsp; But the Association will do far more than that.&nbsp;
It has wisely not confined itself to any one branch of Social
Science, but taken the subject in all its complexity.&nbsp; To do
otherwise would have been to cripple itself.&nbsp; It would have
shut out many subjects&mdash;Law Reform, for instance&mdash;which
are necessary adjuncts to any Sanitary scheme; while it would
have shut out that very large class of benevolent people who have
as yet been devoting their energies to prisons, workhouses, and
schools.&nbsp; Such will now have an opportunity of learning that
they have been treating the symptoms of social disease rather
than the disease itself.&nbsp; They will see that vice is rather
the effect than the cause of physical misery, and that the surest
mode of attacking it is to improve the physical conditions of the
lower classes; to abolish foul air, fouled water, foul lodging,
and overcrowded dwellings, in which morality is difficult, and
common decency impossible.&nbsp; They will not give
up&mdash;Heaven forbid that they should give up!&mdash;their
special good works; but they will surely throw the weight of
their names, their talents, their earnestness, into the great
central object of preserving human life, as soon as they shall
have recognised that prevention is better than cure; and that the
simple and one method of prevention is, to give the working man
his rights.&nbsp; Water, air, light.&nbsp; A right to these three
at least he has.&nbsp; In demanding them, he demands no more than
God gives freely to the wild beast of the forest.&nbsp; Till
society has given him them, it does him an injustice in demanding
of him that he should be a useful member of society.&nbsp; If he
is expected to be a man, let him at least be put on a level with
the brutes.&nbsp; When the benevolent of the land (and they may
be numbered by tens of thousands) shall once have learnt this
plain and yet awful truth, a vast upward step will have been
gained.&nbsp; Because this new Association will teach it them,
during the next ten or twenty years, may God&rsquo;s blessing be
on it, and, on the noble old man who presides over it.&nbsp;
Often already has he deserved well of his country; but never
better than now, when he has lent his great name and great genius
to the object of preserving human life from wholesale destruction
by unnecessary poison.</p>
<p>And meanwhile let the Sanitary Reformer work and wait.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go not after the world,&rdquo; said a wise man, &ldquo;for
if thou stand still long enough the world will come round to
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to Sanitary Reform the world will come
round at last.&nbsp; Grumbling, scoffing, cursing its
benefactors; boasting at last, as usual, that it discovered for
itself the very truths which it tried to silence, it will come;
and will be glad at last to accept the one sibylline leaf, at the
same price at which it might have had the whole.&nbsp; The
Sanitary Reformer must make up his mind to see no fruit of his
labours, much less thanks or reward.&nbsp; He must die in faith,
as St. Paul says all true men die, &ldquo;not having received the
promises;&rdquo; worn out, perhaps, by ill-paid and unappreciated
labour, as that truest-hearted and most unselfish of men, Charles
Robert Walsh, died but two years ago.&nbsp; But his works will
follow him&mdash;not, as the preachers tell us, to
heaven&mdash;for of what use would they be there, to him or to
mankind?&mdash;but here, on earth, where he set them, that they
might go on in his path, after his example, and prosper and
triumph long years after he is dead, when his memory shall be
blessed by generations not merely &ldquo;yet unborn,&rdquo; but
who never would have been born at all, had he not inculcated into
their unwilling fathers the simplest laws of physical health,
decency, life&mdash;laws which the wild cat of the wood, burying
its own excrement apart from its lair, has learnt by the light of
nature; but which neither nature nor God Himself can as yet teach
to a selfish, perverse, and hypocritical generation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
